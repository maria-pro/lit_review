AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of data
   analytics in addressing contemporary challenges and opportunities facing
   institutions of higher education, with a special emphasis on enrollment
   management for the example of a college of business administration in a
   Hispanic-serving four-year institution of higher education.
   Design/methodology/approach After reviewing previous research on this
   subject, the authors propose adding a new stratum to higher education
   analytics, enrollment management analytics, which uniquely identifies
   the actions associated with attracting and recruiting students, accounts
   for institutional differences and leads to students' successful
   matriculation at institutions. Findings The authors demonstrate on the
   example of a professional college in a four-year institution of higher
   education how the utilization of modern analytical tools and techniques
   develop actionable decisions in the students' recruitment process, which
   leads to their matriculation. Originality/value A definition and a new
   stratum in higher education analytics are proposed for enrollment
   management analytics.

AB External audit is undergoing rapid changes where more and more routine
   tasks are automated with analytics and artificial intelligence (AI)
   instruments. The paper addresses a research problem of mapping data
   analytics to audit tasks and develops a framework aligning audit phases
   and AI and using data analytics in teaching audit with AI. The paper
   contributes to the literature on using data analytics with AI in
   knowledge specific areas and particularly critical for emerging audit
   analytics, which is data analytics in external financial audit
   application. The paper employs the process model methodology (Wynn and
   Clarkson, Research in Engineering Design 29:161-202, 2018) and the
   hybrid approach of curriculum development (Dzuranin et al., Journal of
   Accounting Education 43:24-39, 2018). The framework is extended further
   by inclusion of knowledge areas and skills recommendations for each
   identified stage. This inclusion is linked to the peak accounting body
   guidelines to ensure compliance with course certification and future job
   prospects. The developed framework is implemented using audit management
   platform MindBridge AI. The developed teaching and learning materials
   show implementation of the framework on the practical level. The
   developed framework was evaluated in a focus group with accounting
   academics and industry professionals. Its implementation was evaluated
   in a series of workshops and a survey with participants.

AB Supporting teaching and learning programming with learning analytics is
   an active area of inquiry. Most data used for learning analytics
   research comes from learning management systems. However, such systems
   were not developed to support learning programming. Therefore, educators
   have to resort to other systems that support the programming process,
   which can pose a challenge when it comes to understanding students'
   learning since it takes place in different contexts. Methods that
   support the combination of different data sources are needed. Such
   methods would ideally account for the time-ordered sequence of students'
   learning actions. In this article, we use a novel method (multi-channel
   sequence mining with Hidden Markov Models, HMMs) that allows the
   combination of multiple data sources, accounts for the temporal nature
   of students' learning actions, and maps the transitions between
   different learning tactics. Our study included 291 students enrolled in
   a higher education programming course. Students' trace-log data were
   collected from the learning management system and from a programming
   automated assessment tool. Data were analyzed using multi-channel
   sequence mining and HMM. The results reveal different patterns of
   students' approaches to learning programming. High achievers start
   earlier to work on the programming assignments, use more independent
   strategies and consume learning resources more frequently, while the low
   achievers procrastinate early in the course and rely on help forums. Our
   findings demonstrate the potentials of multi-channel sequence mining and
   how this method can be analyzed using HMM. Furthermore, the results
   obtained can be of use for educators to understand students' strategies
   when learning programming.

AB The application of Big Data and time series models is currently at an
   early stage. This paper examines the relevance and use of time series
   analyses for Big Data and business analytics by discussing the emergence
   of Big Data in business, presenting time series models, and providing an
   example of how time series models can be efficiently and effectively
   applied in accounting and auditing using Big Data. Using sophisticated
   Big Data and time series models, millions of transactions can be
   searched to spot patterns and detect abnormalities and irregularities.
   The time series model and Big Data analysis presented in this paper
   provide policy, practical, educational, and research implications.
   Businesses and management can use our suggested time series model and
   Big Data analysis in their predictive models of managerial strategies,
   decisions, and actions. Business schools and accounting programs can
   integrate the time series model, Big Data, and data analytics into
   business and accounting education.

AB The impending fourth industrial revolution has enhanced the role of big
   data analytics in today's business practice. Consequently, many now
   consider big data as the most strategic resource in business to the
   extent that organizations that fail to utilize it may become
   competitively disadvantaged. Following these developments, questions
   have been raised about the future of the accounting discipline,
   especially in terms of how it can continue to add value to
   organizations. While some scholars have attempted to address this
   question, it remains an abstract concept requiring further
   investigation. Therefore, this study conducts a systematic literature
   review to determine the status of accounting research on big data
   analytics and provides avenues for further studies. By conducting
   co-occurrence network analysis on 52 peer-reviewed articles published
   from 2010 to 2020, three broad themes emerged, entailing big data
   implications for accounting practice, education, and research design. A
   further examination of the themes revealed few empirical studies on the
   phenomenon, as conceptual research dominates the field. Although
   external audit implications of big data are widely discussed, other
   accounting domains (e.g., managerial accounting and taxation) are
   underexplored. Therefore, future studies may focus on the implications
   of big data on variables such as performance measurement, information
   governance, tax behavior, curriculum design, and pedagogy.

AB Learning analytics and its emergence in the contemporary educational
   context are addressed. The objective is to assess the signifi-cance and
   emergence of learning analytics in the field of educational sciences and
   its possible contribution to the quality of the per-formance of teaching
   staff. A conceptual understanding of learning analytics is established
   and a reflection is made on the breadth of benefits linked to
   educational sciences, the applications and resources that aid education,
   learning, as well as new opportunities for performance improvement of
   the teaching staff. The most significant challenges to take into account
   in the management of learning analytics for scientific-research and
   educational purposes are also identified. Methods of the theoretical
   level of knowledge are used that allow to locate, classify, process,
   systematize and elaborate the new knowledge. As a conclusion, the
   urgency of updating the teaching staff directed at three aspects is
   reinforced: first, the contents of the discipline it teaches; second,
   the content of educational sciences; and third, the development of the
   digital skills necessary in their professional work in a systematic way.

AB Nowadays, schools use many information systems to automate their
   activities for different stakeholders' groups - learning management
   systems, student diary, library systems, digital repositories, financial
   management and accounting systems, document processing systems, etc. The
   huge amount of data generated by the users of these systems, led to
   increased interest in the collection and analysis of data to encourage
   students to achieve higher results, teachers to provide personalized
   support and school managers to make data-driven decisions at all levels
   of school, and stimulates research into the application of Learning
   Analytics (LA) in schools. The paper presents a LA model and a software
   prototype of the LA tool designed for the needs of Bulgarian school
   education from the perspective of different stakeholder groups
   (students, teachers, class teachers, parents, school managers,
   inspectors from evaluation agencies), aiming to improve school methods
   of approaching and analyzing learning data. The tool allows stakeholders
   to track data for students' learning or training for different purposes,
   e.g. monitoring, analysis, forecast, intervention, recommendations,
   etc., but finally to improve the quality of learning and teaching
   processes. Research and experiments with the model and the LA tool under
   consideration are conducted based on the information infrastructure of a
   typical Bulgarian school.

AB Online teaching environments acquire extremely high granularity of data,
   both on users' personal profiles and on their behaviour and results.
   Learning Analytics (LA) is open to numerous possible research scenarios
   thanks to the development of technology and the speed of data
   collection.
   One characteristic element is that the data are not anonymous, but they
   reproduce a personalization and identification of the profiles.
   Identifiability of the student is implicit in the teaching process, but
   access to Analytics techniques reveals a fundamental question: "What is
   the limit?" The answer to this question should be preliminary to any use
   of data by students, teachers, instructors and managers of the online
   learning environments.
   In the present day, we are also experiencing a particular moment of
   change: the effects of the European General Data Protection Regulation
   (GDPR) 679/2016, the general regulation on the protection of personal
   data that aims to standardize all national legislation and adapt it to
   the new needs dictated by the evolving technological context.
   The objective of this work is to propose a three-point checklist of the
   questions connected to the management and limits of teachers' use of
   data in Learning Analytics and students' right of transparency in the
   context of Higher Digital Education, to take into account before
   conducting research.
   To this end, the paper contains an examination of the literature on
   privacy and ethical debates in LA. Work continues with legislative
   review, particularly the Italian path, and the discussion about online
   data management in our current universities' two contexts: technology
   and legislation.

AB Purpose This paper contributes to the literature by discussing the
   impact of machine learning (ML) on management accounting (MA) and the
   management accountant based on three sources: academic articles, papers
   and reports from accounting bodies and consulting companies. The purpose
   of this paper is to identify, discuss and provide suggestions for how ML
   could be included in research and education in the future for the
   management accountant. Design/methodology/approach This paper identifies
   three types of studies on the influence of ML on MA issued between 2015
   and 2021 in mainstream accounting journals, by professional accounting
   bodies and by large consulting companies. Findings First, only very few
   academic articles actually show examples of using ML or using different
   algorithms related to MA issues. This is in contrast to other research
   fields such as finance and logistics. Second, the literature review also
   indicates that if the management accountants want to keep up with the
   demand of their qualifications, they must take action now and begin to
   discuss how big data and other concepts from artificial intelligence and
   ML can benefit MA and the management accountant in specific ways.
   Originality/value Even though the paper may be classified as
   inspirational in nature, the paper documents and discusses the revised
   environment that surrounds the accountant today. The paper concludes by
   highlighting specifically the necessity of including exploratory data
   analysis and unsupervised ML in the field of MA to close the existing
   gaps in both education and research and thus making the MA profession
   future-proof.

AB To assist higher education institutions in meeting the challenge of
   limited student engagement in the implementation of Learning Analytics
   services, the Questionnaire for Student Expectations of Learning
   Analytics (SELAQ) was developed. This instrument contains 12 items,
   which are explained by a purported two-factor structure of "Ethical and
   Privacy Expectations" and "Service Feature Expectations." As it stands,
   however, the SELAQ has only been validated with students from UK
   university, which is problematic on account of the interest in Learning
   Analytics extending beyond this context. Thus, the aim of the current
   work was to assess whether the translated SELAQ can be validated in
   three contexts (an Estonian, a Spanish, and a Dutch University). The
   findings show that the model provided acceptable fits in both the
   Spanish and Dutch samples, but was not supported in the Estonian student
   sample. In addition, an assessment of local fit is undertaken for each
   sample, which provides important points that need to be considered in
   future work. Finally, a general comparison of expectations across
   contexts is undertaken, which are discussed in relation to the General
   Data Protection Regulation (2018).

   Findings based on data collected from 108 Croatian firms confirmed that
   IIS implementation caused significant management accounting changes.
   Estimated regression models revealed that the most important IIS
   characteristic were the analytical capabilities since it positively
   influenced management accounting changes in four dimensions: internal
   reporting, budgeting, application of modern accounting techniques and
   management accounting employees' jobs. The quality of IIS implementation
   statistically significantly and positively influenced changes related to
   data collection and internal reporting. In the segment of budgeting, the
   quality of implementation of specialized budgeting software had
   significant and positive influence. The only negative correlation found
   was the one between the uncertainty of business environment and adoption
   of modern accounting techniques. Findings from this study provide unique
   insight into effects of IIS implementation in Croatian firms and can be
   used by different stakeholders. Firms and IIS vendors should put special
   focus on implementation of business analytics modules in order to
   achieve comprehensive benefits in management accounting practices.

   in grades. The relationship varied significantly depending on student,

AB Over the last 20 years, big data techniques in teaching have been
   overgrown. Making educational decisions now includes information
   knowledge as a crucial component. This started a trend for using big
   data algorithms strategically. Technological advances have been used to
   analyze the enormous amount of information and develop strategic
   judgments. The current study aims to address issues with the
   conventional instructional, administrative management solution focused
   on manual rule formulation in big data storage and interpretation and
   has poor efficiency in analyzing big data and lacking value in
   developing education leadership qualities. The study suggests an
   educational leadership model based on big data algorithm (ELM-BDA) to
   explore the student leadership performance that relies on cooperative
   filtration and fuzzy C-means (FCM) and big data. The different
   influencing mechanisms and factors directly linked to educational
   leadership were also analyzed using a big data algorithm. To build an
   intelligent institutional administrative system, the research also
   exposes it to organizational studies. By evaluating the big data
   research already in existence, this study emphasizes the expanding
   significance of big data. Additionally, this study explores the effects
   of big data analytics on educational leadership qualities by utilizing
   an FCM. A scoring system is designed to predict the student's leadership
   level, and using the big data algorithms, the students are motivated and
   trained to improve their skills. The education and learning method can
   be enhanced at educational institutions through better decision-making
   to use this big data for leadership development. Big data facilitates
   efficient educational decision-making by merging various data and
   telecommunications technologies. Using big data in schooling will
   increase-leadership quality among students. To effectively use big data
   for decision-making, academic leaders must create new types of learning
   and monitoring systems.

AB The Web of Data is an emerging research field that contributes to make
   better decisions because it gathers, combines and analyses different
   data sources available worldwide. Educational data is an interesting
   domain because it deals with the quality of the education itself and
   educational institutions which are common goals for every country. This
   paper is devoted to present how this idea has been used to improve a
   learning analytics tool. By means of this tool, teachers can perform
   teamwork competence assessment of a group of students taking into
   account how the individuals acquire the essential components of such
   competence. In this sense, authors use the Comprehensive Training Model
   of the Teamwork Competence in Engineering Domain (CTMTC) method to
   gather competence evidences and improve the system with a learning
   analytics tool to support the process. This tool is able to transform
   competence evidences and stores them in a competence ontology built upon
   ISO 10018 concepts. The final result is the production of educational
   results for the web of data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Precision education is a new challenge in leveraging artificial
   intelligence, machine learning, and learning analytics to enhance
   teaching quality and learning performance. To facilitate precision
   education, text marking skills can be used to determine students'
   learning process. Text marking is an essential learning skill in
   reading. In this study, we proposed a model that leverages the
   state-of-the-art text summarization technique, Bidirectional Encoder
   Representations from Transformers (BERT), to calculate the marking score
   for 130 graduate students enrolled in an accounting course. Then, we
   applied learning analytics to analyze the correlation between their
   marking scores and learning performance. We measured students'
   self-regulated learning (SRL) and clustered them into four groups based
   on their marking scores and marking frequencies to examine whether
   differences in reading skills and text marking influence students'
   learning performance and awareness of self-regulation. Consistent with
   past research, our results did not indicate a strong relationship
   between marking scores and learning performance. However, high-skill
   readers who use more marking strategies perform better in learning
   performance, task strategies, and time management than high-skill
   readers who use fewer marking strategies. Furthermore, high-skill
   readers who actively employ marking strategies also achieve superior
   scores of environment structure, and task strategies in SRL than
   low-skill readers who are inactive in marking. The findings of this
   research provide evidence supporting the importance of monitoring and
   training students' text marking skill and facilitating precision
   education.

AB Learning programming is a complex and challenging task for many
   students. It involves both understanding theoretical concepts and
   acquiring practical skills. Hence, analyzing learners' data from online
   learning environments alone fails to capture the full breadth of
   students' actions if part of their learning process takes place
   elsewhere. Moreover, existing studies on learning analytics applied to
   programming education have mainly relied on frequency analysis to
   classify students according to their approach to programming or to
   predict academic achievement. However, frequency analysis provides
   limited insights into the individual time-related characteristics of the
   learning process. The current study examines students' strategies when
   learning programming, combining data from the learning management system
   and from an automated assessment tool used to support students while
   solving the programming assignments. The study included the data of 292
   engineering students (228 men and 64 women, aged 20-26) from the two
   aforementioned sources. To gain an in-depth understanding of students'
   learning process as well as of the types of learners, we used learning
   analytics methods that account for the temporal order of learning
   actions. Our results show that students have special preferences for
   specific learning resources when learning programming, namely, slides
   that support search, and copy and paste. We also found that videos are
   relatively less consumed by students, especially while working on
   programming assignments. Lastly, students resort to course forums to
   seek help only when they struggle.

AB Student's attitudes towards Statistics are pivotal to their learning
   process as positive attitudes lead to highly satisfactory course
   achievement and lead to positive outcomes outside class as well. In this
   paper we are exploring the perception of students of management apropos
   Statistics, familiarity with which is imperative in today's world of
   Analytics. The quantitative approach was used to compare attitudes of
   the students using the two versions of the "SATS-36" instrument
   validated and copyrighted by Candace Schau. A Google form was used to
   collect responses and was sent to all the students who were enrolled in
   the Business Statistics course. 172 students responded for the pre-test
   study while 71 students responded for the post-test study. Data was
   analysed to see if gender, specialisation choices and previous math
   experiences accounted for differences in perceptions towards Statistics.
   It was found that students' overall perception of statistics is positive
   and surprisingly they were more positive towards the beginning of the
   semester. These results are important as they can lead towards
   understanding of business student's attitudes towards statistics and a
   way to refine the teaching learning process so that students are in a
   strong position to exploit the supply demand gap in the Analytics domain
   and deliver value to organisations.

AB The challenge of nurse staffing is amplified in the acute care neonatal
   intensive care unit (NICU) setting, where a wide range of highly
   variable factors affect staffing. A comprehensive overview of infant
   factors (severity, intensity), nurse factors (education, experience,
   preferences, team dynamics), and unit factors (structure, layout, shift
   length, care model) influencing pre-shift NICU staffing is presented,
   along with how intra-shift variability of these and other factors must
   be accounted for to maintain effective and efficient assignments. There
   is opportunity to improve workload estimations and acuity measures for
   pre-shift staffing using technology and predictive analytics. Nurse
   staffing decisions affected by intra-shift factor variability can be
   enhanced using novel care models that decentralize decision-making.
   Improving NICU staffing requires a deliberate, systematic, data-driven
   approach, with commitment from nurses, resources from the management
   team, and an institutional culture prioritizing patient safety.

AB Student retention and timely graduation are enduring challenges in
   higher education. With the rapidly expanding collection and availability
   of learning data and related analytics, student performance can be
   accurately monitored, and possibly predicted ahead of time, thus,
   enabling early warning and degree planning "expert systems" to provide
   disciplined decision support to counselors, advisors, and educators.
   Previous work in educational data mining has explored matrix
   factorization techniques for grade prediction, albeit without taking
   contextual information into account. Temporal information should be
   informative as it distinguishes between the different class offerings
   and indirectly captures student experience as well. To exploit temporal
   and/or other kinds of context, we develop three approaches under the
   framework of collaborative filtering (CF). Two of the proposed
   approaches build upon coupled matrix factorization with a shared latent
   matrix factor. The third utilizes tensor factorization to model grades
   and their context, without introducing a new mode per context dimension
   as is common in the CF literature. The latent factors obtained can be
   used to predict grades and context, if desired. We evaluate these
   approaches on grade data obtained from the University of Minnesota.
   Experimental results show that fairly good prediction is possible even
   with simple approaches, but very accurate prediction is hard. The more
   advanced approaches can increase prediction accuracy, but only up to a
   point for the particular dataset considered.

   apply the Comprehensive Case Management Path.
   Primary Practice Settings(s): Applicable to health and behavioral health
   settings where case management is practiced.
   Findings/Conclusions: When professional case managers use comprehensive
   assessments to inform their work with populations impacted by the SDH,
   barriers to care access can be more readily addressed (e.g., poverty,
   employment, housing insufficiency, health literacy, migration, and
   medication adherence). Initiatives, programming, and treatment plans can
   be advanced to provide target populations with individualized and
   appropriate intervention. Case management involvement can also be
   leveraged to coordinate and facilitate successful interprofessional team
   efforts (Casteneda, Holmes, Madrigal, DeTrinidad, Beyeler, & Quesada,
   2015; Davis, 2016).
   Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers must engage
   clients from a wholistic lens that reflects their standards of practice
   and accounts for all domains of assessment: medical, cognitive and
   behavioral, functional, and social. Comprehensive tools to guide a
   robust and exhaustive screening of issues and opportunities ensure more

AB Today, it is almost impossible to implement teaching processes without
   using information and communication technologies (ICT), especially in
   higher education. Education institutions often use learning management
   systems (LMS), such as Moodle, Edmodo, Canvas, Schoology, Blackboard
   Learn, and others. When accessing these systems with their personal
   account, each student's activity is recorded in a log file. Moodle
   system allows not only information saving. The plugins of this LMS
   provide a fast and accurate analysis of training statistics. Within the
   study, the capabilities of several Moodle plugins providing the
   assessment of students' activity and success are reviewed. The research
   is aimed at discovering possibilities to improve the learning process
   and reduce the number of underperforming students. The activity logs of
   124 participants are analyzed to identify the relations between the
   number of logs during the e-course and the final grades. In the study, a
   correlation analysis is performed to determine the impact of students'
   educational activity in the Moodle system on the final assessment. The
   results reveal that gender affiliation correlates with the overall
   performance but does not affect the selection of training materials.
   Furthermore, it is shown that students who got the highest grades
   performed at least 210 logs during the course. It is noted that the
   prevailing part of students prefers to complete the tasks before the
   deadline. The study concludes that LMSs can be used to predict students'
   success and stimulate better results during the study. The findings are
   proposed to be used in higher education institutions for early detection
   of students experiencing difficulties in a course.

   technical-scientific and market knowledge. Thus, this research aimed to
   investigate the technical and transversal competences proposed in the
   training of the controller, from the perception of the professors who
   teach the disciplines of Controlling and/or Management Accounting, in
   the Accounting Science undergraduate courses in Recife - PE, in view of
   the demands of the labor market. Since there is a demand about what
   would be the profile of the professional controller nowadays, not only
   in terms of which technical competences are required, but also in
   relation to transversal competences, this study is justified as it
   contributes to this theme. This research is classified as exploratory
   and descriptive in terms of objectives, with a qualitative approach
   regarding the problem. Data collection was carried out through a survey
   among the 37 active courses of 35 higher education institutions in
   Recife - PE, using an electronic questionnaire, obtaining 48.6% of
   responses from the professors. The study showed that, in the view of the
   professors, most of the skills most demanded by the job market are
   technical and just over a third are transversal. All the competences
   listed for the professors were identified as being worked on in their
   disciplines, although in different intensities, and the most cited among
   the technical and transversal competences were: Cost Management,
   Accounting and Finance, Information Management, Planning, Strategic
   Vision and Capacity Analytics.

AB Purpose This paper aims to explore the changing role of the accountant
   amid multiple drivers, responses of accountants and situated rationality
   in a multinational firm, Max-choice Lanka. Design/methodology/approach
   It adopts the single-site case study approach under the qualitative
   methodology and leans on institutional theory, specifically Ter Bogt and
   Scapens (2019) framework. Findings The case study findings reveal that
   the role of the accountant has undergone change amid local and broader
   institutions linked to organizational culture/norms, the influence of
   the parent company, global trends and technological advancements. Based
   on evolving situated rationalities, the contemporary accountant performs
   an agile role as a value-adding business partner; data scientist;
   strategic decision-maker; and a cross-functional team member. Practical
   implications At the practice level, identifying drivers influencing the
   changing role of accountants enables organizations to shape their
   accounting functions attuned to evolving needs by implementing
   appropriate strategies and recruiting competent personnel. In the realm
   of education, it calls for incorporating areas such as big data
   analytics, artificial intelligence, reporting nonfinancial information
   and integrated accounting software to the accounting curricular and
   upskill students based on industry expectations catering to changing
   roles. Originality/value This paper adds to the ongoing debate on the
   contemporary role of the accountant. Capitalizing on case study data,
   this research illuminates the influence of multiplicity of institutions,
   different forms and situated rationality within this changing role and
   extends the Ter Bogt and Scapens (2019) framework.

AB Background: Educationally designed videos have the advantage of
   explaining difficult concepts via graphic diagrams and dynamic
   illustrations. The benefits of videos will be enhanced if videos are
   well-designed, concise, explore scientifically correct content, and have
   a clear presentation. Aims: Video as an open educational resource (OER)
   is the cornerstone for online learning. YouTube has been widely used as
   a distribution platform for OER. The aim of this study was to evaluate
   the engagement of hand surgery videos on a dedicated education channel
   on YouTube. Methods: The senior author has been utilizing a YouTube
   channel dedicated to the education of clinicians in Hand Surgery,
   surgical education, and management since 2008. The degree of engagement
   was evaluated using YouTube Analytics, providing up-to-date metrics and
   reports. Results: Since 2008, there have been 6521 subscribers with
   1,360,680 views, a total view time of 35,033 h and an average view time
   of 1.72 min. The channel views averaged 1000 views per day. There were
   4,324,724 impressions with a 7.32% click-through rate, with the United
   States of America accounting for 23.5% of the audience. YouTube search
   accounted for 33.3% of the traffic source and suggested videos by others
   were 19.4%, and external links were 19%. Playback location was through
   mobile devices in 76.7%, while 16% was through the computer. The two
   popular playlists were "flaps in hand surgery" (50.2%) and "basic hand
   surgery workshop" (21.9%). Sharing by WhatsApp was most popular (27.9%)
   in embedded websites and apps. Overall there were 488 comments on the
   channel. Conclusion: This paper confirms the phenomenon of
   micro-learning by online learners. It is recommended that educational
   videos as OER should be confined to 2 min, made compatible for the
   mobile device, and be optimized for sharing on social media. These can
   be used as resources for blended learning, allowing better utilization
   of time for deliberate practice in surgical training.

AB Purpose
   Nearly 40 years since they first appeared, there is renewed interest in
   dashboards, engendered by the diffusion of business intelligence (BI)
   desktop software, such as Power BI, QlikView and Tableau, denoted
   collectively as "self-service" BI. Using these commodity software tools,
   the work to construct dashboards apparently becomes easier and more
   manageable and no longer requires the intervention of specialists. This
   paper aims to analyse the implementation of this kind of commodity
   dashboard in a university, exploring its role in performance management
   processes and investigating whether the dashboard affects the
   organisation (or not).
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper focusses on an action research project developed by the
   authors, where the objective was to design and implement a dynamic
   performance measurement tool fitting the needs of department directors.
   The three authors were all involved in the project, respectively, as
   project manager, dashboard implementation manager and accounting manager
   of the studied organisation.
   Findings
   The results reveal a specific but complex change to the procedures and
   outcomes in the organisation studied, where the dashboard becomes a
   boundary infrastructure, thereby reviving technical and organisational
   problems that had been latent for years.
   Originality/value
   In this paper, the authors contribute to the debate on the digital age
   and the role of accounting with their exploration into the "revolution"
   of self-service BI tools. The democratisation and flexibility of these
   instruments put into discussion two core and somewhat controversial
   functions of accounting: data integration and personalised reporting.

AB BACKGROUND: Considerable evidence suggests that social media usage has
   become an indispensible part of international expatriates' daily lives.
   Studies have identified social media usage serves both as a positive and
   a negative channel to influence international expatriate's personal
   development. Nevertheless, there is paucity of literature examining the
   effects and underlying mechanism through which social media usage
   impinges on international expatriates' creativity, especially in
   cross-cultural settings.
   OBJECTIVE: To address the gaps, the current research is designed to
   investigate whether and how social media usage accounts for variance
   phenomena in international expatriates' creativity with intervention
   role of cultural intelligence.
   METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted at three Chinese public
   universities with assistance of officials in charge of international
   education. 248 informative responses were used for testing hypothesis.
   RESULTS: Research findings suggest that social media usage contributes
   to international expatriates' creativity partially through the conduit
   of peer relationship. Additionally cultural intelligence positively
   moderates the relationship between social media usage and peer
   relationship.
   CONCLUSIONS: As the elite group who make quick responses and efficacious
   solutions to manage the complexities in such an interconnected world,
   international expatriates deserve more scholarly attention for their
   creativity development. The current research examines the mediating role
   of peer relationship and the role of cultural intelligence moderating
   the relationship between social media usage and peer relationship. And
   this paper serves to arouse more scholarly attention to apply
   interdisciplinary analytics approaches to investigate how to develop
   international expatriate's creativity in complicated cross-cultural
   settings.

AB Recent trends in educational technology have led to emergence of methods
   such as teaching analytics (TA) in understanding and management of the
   teaching-learning processes. Didactically, teaching analytics is one of
   the promising and emerging methods within the Education domain that have
   proved to be useful, towards scholastic ways to make use of substantial
   pieces of evidence drawn from educational data to improve the
   teaching-learning processes and quality of performance. For this
   purpose, this study proposed an educational process and data mining plus
   machine learning (EPDM + ML) model applied to contextually analyze the
   teachers' performances and recommendations based on data derived from
   students' evaluation of teaching (SET). The EPDM + ML model was designed
   and implemented based on amalgamation of the Text mining and Machine
   learning technologies that builds on the descriptive decision theory,
   which studies the rationality behind decisions the learners are disposed
   to make based on the textual data quantification and statistical
   analysis. To this effect, the study determines pedagogical factors that
   influences the students' recommendations for their teachers, what role
   the sentiment and emotions expressed by the students in the SET play in
   the way they evaluate the teachers by taking into account the gender of
   the teachers. This includes how to automatically predict what a
   student's recommendation for the teachers may be based on information
   about the students' gender, average sentiment, and emotional valence
   they have shown in the SET. Practically, we applied the Text mining
   technique to extract the different sentiments and emotions (intensities
   of the comments) expressed by the students in the SET, and then utilized
   the quantified data (average sentiment and emotional valence) to conduct
   an analysis of covariance and Kruskal Wallis Test to determine the
   influential factors, as well as, how the students' recommendation for
   the teachers differ by considering the gender constructs, respectively.
   While a large proportion of the comments that we analyzed (n = 85,378)
   was classified to be neutral and predominantly interpreted to be
   positive in nature considering the sentiments (76.4%), and emotional
   valence (88.2%) expressed by the students. The results of our analysis
   shows that for the students' comments which contain some kind of
   positive or negative sentiment (23.6%) and emotional valence (11.8%);
   that females students recommended the teachers taking into account the
   sentiments (p = .000). While the males appear to be slightly borderline
   in terms of emotions (p = .056) and sentiment (p = .077). Also, the EPDM
   + ML model showed to be a good predictor and efficient method in
   determining what the students' recommendation scores for the teachers
   would be, going by the high and acceptable values of the precision
   (1.00), recall (1.00), specificity (1.00), accuracy (1.00), F1-score
   (1.00) and zero error-rate (0.00) which we validated using the k-fold
   cross-validation method, with 63.6% of optimal k-values observed. In
   theory, we note that not only does the proposed method (EPDM + ML)
   proves to be useful towards effective analysis of SET and its
   implications within the educational domain.
   But can be utilized to determine prominent factors that influences the
   students' evaluation and recommendation of the teachers, as well as
   helps provide solutions to the ever-increasingly need to advance and
   support the teaching-learning processes and/or students' learning
   experiences in a rapidly changing educational environment or ecosystem.

AB Purpose of Review Accurate and timely diagnosis of Clostridioides
   difficile infection (CDI) is imperative to prevent C. difficile
   transmission and reduce morbidity and mortality due to CDI, but CDI
   laboratory diagnostics are complex. The purpose of this article is to
   review the role of laboratory tests in the diagnosis of CDI and the role
   of diagnostic stewardship in optimization of C. difficile testing.
   Recent Findings Results from C. difficile diagnostic tests should be
   interpreted with an understanding of the strengths and limitations
   inherent in each testing approach. Use of highly sensitive molecular
   diagnostic tests without accounting for clinical signs and symptoms may
   lead to over-diagnosis of CDI and increased facility CDI rates. Current
   guidelines recommend a two-step, algorithmic approach for testing.
   Diagnostic stewardship interventions, such as education, order sets,
   order search menus, reflex orders, hard and soft stop alerts, electronic
   references, feedback and benchmarking, decision algorithms, and
   predictive analytics, may help improve use of C. difficile laboratory
   tests and CDI diagnosis. The diagnostic stewardship approaches with the
   highest reported success rates include computerized clinical decision
   support (CCDS) interventions, face-to-face feedback, and real-time
   evaluations. CDI is a clinical diagnosis supported by laboratory
   findings. Together, clinical evaluation combined with diagnostic
   stewardship can optimize the accurate diagnosis of CDI.

AB Effective agricultural water management requires accurate, continuous,
   and transparent accounting of water use in irrigated agroecosystems,
   especially in water-limited regions where moratoriums may be imposed.
   Advances in sensor technologies, networking, and data analytics can aid
   in fulfilling this task by automatically collecting, analyzing and
   reporting real-time data to infer irrigators' practices and behaviors,
   crop water requirements, water applications and use. In this research,
   an automated irrigation water withdrawal and water use monitoring and
   data collection system was deployed to monitor actual irrigation
   dynamics for 31 commercial and large-scale agricultural production
   fields for three consecutive years. Production scale fields
   (representing a total of 1050 ha) included center pivot (P), gravity
   (surface/furrow) (G) and subsurface drip-irrigated (S) fields. On
   average, irrigation was initiated 40-70 days after planting (DAP) and
   terminated by 120-140 DAP. The proportion of irrigation systems
   operating simultaneously and peak water abstraction were highest (70-90
   %) during July and August. Mean depth of water applied across all fields
   was 243, 264 and 284 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
   Site-specific monitoring of precipitation, soil moisture, and
   evaporative demand and a soil-water balance model resulted in mean
   seasonal irrigation requirement estimates of 394, 242 and 184 mm, in
   2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively; for maize; and 307, 163 and 219 mm in
   2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, for soybean. Despite reduction of
   calculated mean irrigation requirement in 2014 and 2015 by 40-50 %,
   actual irrigation applications by producers did not change considerably
   and irrigation applied exceeded irrigation water requirements in 80 % of
   the fields, suggesting needs for irrigation water management technology
   implementation and associated educational programs in the region. Some
   fields showed irrigation applications exceeding the mean annual
   allocated (moratorium) irrigation depth (305 mm), implying that
   irrigation decisions are still largely driven by non-scientific and/or
   technical methods. While substantial farm-to-farm heterogeneity makes it
   challenging to robustly benchmarking regional water footprint and
   irrigator behavior, it also creates an opportunity for developing and
   implementing methodologies and strategies for real-time monitoring of
   farm-level irrigation dynamics. New advances in technologies with
   telemetry capabilities as well as internet of things (IoTs) can be
   leveraged to effectively create databases, track and compare water usage
   to better plan, allocate, distribute, monitor and manage limited water
   resources for enhancing agricultural productivity. These processes can
   also be used for education and demonstration for irrigation
   professionals to enhance adoption of such technologies. This research
   has the potential for technology and strategy transfer for advanced
   water management to other regions in the United States and globally.

AB Higher educational institutes (HEI) are adopting ubiquitous and smart
   equipment such as mobile devices or digital gadgets to deliver
   educational content in a more effective manner than the traditional
   approaches. In present works, a lot of smart classroom approaches have
   been developed, however, the student learning experience is not yet
   fully explored. Moreover, module historical data over time is not
   considered which could provide insight into the possible outcomes in the
   future, leading new improvements and working as an early detection
   method for the future results within the module. This paper proposes a
   framework by taking into account module historical data in order to
   predict module performance, particularly the module result before the
   commencement of classes with the goal of improving module pass
   percentage. Furthermore, a video streaming server along with blended
   learning are sequentially integrated with the designed framework to
   ensure correctness of teaching and learning pedagogy. Simulation results
   demonstrate that by considering module historical data using time series
   forecasting helps in improving module performance in terms of module
   delivery and result outcome in terms of pass percentage. Furthermore,
   the proposed framework provides a mechanism for faculties to adjust
   their teaching style according to student performance level to minimize
   the student failure rate.

   of the changes that Artificial Intelligence ("AI") is already bringing
   to the universe of legal services. Part I briefly describes some of the
   ways AI is already in use in ordinary life - from facial recognition,
   through medical diagnosis to translation services. Part II describes how
   AI is transforming what it means to provide legal services in six
   primary areas: litigation review; expertise automation; legal research;
   contract analytics; contract and litigation document generation; and
   predictive analytics. Part III explores who are the providers of these
   AI driven legal services - often non-lawyer legal service providers -
   and how these providers are replacing at least some of what clients have
   traditionally sought from lawyers. Part III also discusses the
   implications of all these changes both for the future role of lawyers
   individually, and in particular what services will clients still need
   lawyers to perform: judgment, empathy, creativity and adaptability. In
   turn, this Part examines what will these changes mean for the size,
   shape, composition and economic model of law firms, as well as the
   implications of these changes for legal education and lawyer training.
   Part IV identifies the principal legal, ethical, regulatory and risk
   management issues raised by the use of AI in the provision of legal
   services. Finally, in Part V the article considers who will be the
   likely providers of AI based services other than law firms: legal
   publishers, major accounting firms and venture capital funded
   businesses.

AB There is growing recognition of the need for a coordinated, systematic
   approach to caring for patients with a tracheostomy.
   Tracheostomy-related adverse events remain a pervasive global problem,
   accounting for half of all airway-related deaths and hypoxic brain
   damage in critical care units. The Global Tracheostomy Collaborative
   (GTC) was formed in 2012 to improve patient safety and quality of care,
   emphasising knowledge, skills, teamwork, and patient-centred approaches.
   Inspired by quality improvement leads in Australia, the UK, and the USA,
   the GTC implements and disseminates best practices across hospitals and
   healthcare trusts. Its database collects patient-level information on
   quality, safety, and organisational efficiencies. The GTC provides an
   organising structure for quality improvement efforts, promoting safety
   of paediatric and adult patients. Successful implementation requires
   instituting key drivers for change that include effective training for
   health professionals; multidisciplinary team collaboration; engagement
   and involvement of patients, their families, and carers; and data
   collection that allows tracking of outcomes. We report the history of
   the collaborative, its database infrastructure and analytics, and
   patient outcomes from more than 6500 patients globally. We characterise
   this patient population for the first time at such scale, reporting
   predictors of adverse events, mortality, and length of stay indexed to
   patient characteristics, co-morbidities, risk factors, and context. In
   one example, the database allowed identification of a previously
   unrecognised association between bleeding and mortality, reflecting
   ability to uncover latent risks and promote safety. The GTC provides the
   foundation for future risk-adjusted benchmarking and a learning
   community that drives ongoing quality improvement efforts worldwide.

AB Students' interaction and collaboration using Internet of Things (loT)
   based interoperable infrastructure is a convenient way. Measuring
   student attention is an essential part of educational assessment. As new
   learning styles develop, new tools and assessment methods are also
   needed. The focus of this paper is to develop loT-based interaction
   framework and analysis of the student experience of electronic learning
   (eLearning). The learning behaviors of students attending remote video
   lectures are assessed by logging their behavior and analyzing the
   resulting multimedia data using machine learning algorithms. An
   attention-scoring algorithm, its workflow, and the mathematical
   formulation for the smart assessment of the student learning experience
   are established. This setup has a data collection module, which can be
   reproduced by implementing the algorithm in any modern programming
   language. Some faces, eyes, and status of eyes are extracted from video
   stream taken from a webcam using this module. The extracted information
   is saved in a dataset for further analysis. The analysis of the dataset
   produces interesting results for student learning assessments. Modern
   learning management systems can integrate the developed tool to take
   student learning behaviors into account when assessing electronic
   learning strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With Big Data revolution, the education sector is being reshaped. The
   current data-driven education system provides many opportunities to
   utilize the enormous amount of collected data about students' activities
   and performance for personalized education, adapting teaching methods,
   and decision making. On the other hand, such benefits come at a cost to
   privacy. For example, the identification of a student's poor performance
   across multiple courses. While several works have been conducted on
   quantifying the re-identification risks of individuals in released
   datasets, they assume an adversary's prior knowledge about target
   individuals. Most of them do not utilize all the available information
   in the datasets. For example, event-level information that associates
   multiple records to the same individual and correlation between
   attributes. In this work, we propose a method using a Markov Model (MM)
   to quantify re-identification risks using all available information in
   the data under a more realistic threat model that assumes different
   levels of an adversary's knowledge about the target individual, ranging
   from any one of the attributes to all given attributes. Moreover, we
   propose a workflow for efficiently calculating MM risk which is highly
   scalable to large number of attributes. Experimental results from real
   education datasets show the efficacy of our model for re-identification
   risk.

TI Classification of the existing knowledge base of OR/MS research and

AB Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS) has traditionally been
   defined as the discipline that applies advanced analytical methods to
   help make better and more informed decisions. The purpose of this paper
   is to present an analysis of the existing knowledge base of OR/MS
   research and practice using a proposed keywords-based approach. A
   conceptual structure is necessary in order to place in context the
   findings of our keyword analysis. Towards this we first present a
   classification scheme that relies on keywords that appeared in articles
   published in important OR/MS journals from 1990-2019 (over 82,000
   articles). Our classification scheme applies a methodological approach
   towards keyword selection and its systematic classification, wherein
   approximately 1300 most frequently used keywords (in terms of cumulative
   percentage, these keywords and their derivations account for more than
   45% of the approx. 290,000 keyword occurrences used by the authors to
   represent the content of their articles) were selected and organised in
   a classification scheme with seven top-level categories and multiple
   levels of sub-categories. The scheme identified the most commonly used
   keywords relating to OR/MS problems, modeling techniques and
   applications. Next, we use this proposed scheme to present an analysis
   of the last 30 years, in three distinct time periods, to show the
   changes in OR/MS literature. The contribution of the paper is thus
   twofold, (a) the development of a proposed discipline-based
   classification of keywords (like the ACM Computer Classification System
   and the AMS Mathematics Subject Classification), and (b) an analysis of
   OR/MS research and practice using the proposed classification. (C) 2020
