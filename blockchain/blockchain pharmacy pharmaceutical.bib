   pharmaceutical sphere with the purpose of detection of counterfeit and
   poor-quality medicinal products and discusses the legal acts concerning
   the use of this technology. Author examines the grounds for the legal
   provision of blockchain technology in pharmaceutical sector in order to
   protect the rights of patients. The necessity of legal regulation of the
   use of blockchain technology by private parties is substantiated taking
   into account the private legal nature of this system. The mechanism of

Abstract = {This paper summarizes the actual adaptation of the Blockchain (BC)
   technology in the global trade space. Each product with a unique
   identification is tracked from the source manufacturer to the end user
   across countries. Data is collected from manufacturers, logistics
   providers and end users. A third-party company serves as the BC network
   operator so that each transaction is recorded in a private BC network
   with periodical hash saved onto a public BC network to ensure data
   immutability. This paper further explores the use of BC to manage the
   owner and users of data sources. There are two business applications for
   this system: (1) track and deliver using direct-to-consumer model for
   over 100 premium California wineries to over 20 countries in the world;
   (2) track and deliver using direct-to-hospital model for specialty
   pharmaceuticals (cancer drugs, etc.) from the US to designated hospitals
   in China.},

Abstract = {This research tries to prove low-cost computer devices such as
   mini-computers can be used in the development of blockchain technology.
   Mini-computer technology is used because of many problems that occur due
   to the use of hardware resources that are discussed large, specifically
   in the pharmaceutical industry in the process drug makers, packing drugs
   (drug packaging identities), checking drugs, installations (printing
   drug identities), and this use to label drug to read posts on drug
   strips, to make the products used by customers better. This study uses
   an experimental design. Experiments were carried out with devices to use
   and blockchain technology. The device used is a Raspberry Pi
   mini-computer, and blockchain technology is the Ethereum platform. The
   results of this study indicate the installation process until the
   blockchain system can run. The results show that the raspberry pi device
   can be implemented with Ethereum blockchain technology correctly and
   adequately.},

Abstract = {Recently, blockchain technology was introduced to the public in order to
   provide a secure environment that is immutable, consensus-based and
   transparent in the finance technology world. However, there have been
   many efforts to apply blockchain to other fields where trust and
   transparency are a requirement. The ability to reliably share
   pharmaceutical information between various stakeholders is essential.
   The use of blockchain technology adds traceability and visibility to
   supply chains such as pharmaceuticals to provide all the information
   from end to end. Currently, the data is stored and managed by large
   manufacturers and pharmacy retailers using their own centralized
   systems. Several existing approaches and methods that allow
   pharmaceutical information to be stored and shared between the
   healthcare provider and other stakeholders in a centralized manner have
   been discussed in the literature. Due to the lack of comprehensive
   literature review studies that focus on pharmaceutical supply chain
   using blockchain technology, thus this paper highlights and addresses
   this gap. This paper reviews several studies which have applied
   blockchain technology in pharmaceutical supply chains. This paper
   overviews the knowledge on blockchain technology, discusses and explores
   the most recent and relevant studies that adopt blockchain technology in
   the field of pharmaceutical supply chains, describes the challenges
   associated with blockchain technology, and presents some ideas for
   future work.},

Abstract = {The blockchain and smart contract technologies have increasingly been
   introduced in several industrial markets. The blockchain can also
   effectively and potentially be used as a disruptive method to
   significantly improve the drug life cycle management. The cycle includes
   drug discovery, development, manufacturing, distribution, use, and
   finally disposal. In this short communication, we highlighted the
   general pros and cons of the blockchain technologies as well as the
   specific areas that can benefit from a digital ledger technology
   equipped with smart contracts. Although disruptive blockchain technology
   cannot be adopted, implemented, and solve the existing issues overnight,
   we believe that pharmaceutical and biotech scientists, research
   institutions, pharmaceutical manufacturers, government authorities, and
   public health systems will be the major beneficiary of its adoption in
   the long run.},

Abstract = {This research identifies a conceptual e-Prescription system based on
   blockchain technology. The system utilizes cryptocurrency principles
   applied to the electronic prescription processes to achieve its goals.
   This e-Prescription system can be utilized as a combatant to the
   nationwide opioid crisis as a potential Prescription Drug Monitoring
   System (PDMP). While not a fully evaluated system, the proof of concept
   results presented have significant demonstrated potential. Moreover, the
   concepts can be used to create a system that can serve as an inspiration
   to use blockchain technology in healthcare applications.},

Abstract = {Pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) consists of multiple stakeholders
   including raw material suppliers, manufacturers, distributors,
   regulatory authorities, pharmacies, hospitals, and patients. The
   complexity of product and transaction flows in PSC requires an effective
   traceability system to determine the current and all previous product
   ownerships. In addition, digitizing track and trace process provides
   significant benefit for regulatory oversight and ensures product safety.
   Blockchain-based drug traceability offers a potential solution to create
   a distributed shared data platform for an immutable, trustworthy,
   accountable and transparent system in the PSC. In this paper, we present
   an overview of product traceability issues in the PSC and envisage how
   blockchain technology can provide effective provenance, track and trace
   solution to mitigate counterfeit medications. We propose two potential
   blockchain based decentralized architectures, Hyperledger Fabric and
   Besu to meet critical requirements for drug traceability such as
   privacy, trust, transparency, security, authorization and
   authentication, and scalability. We propose, discuss, and compare two
   potential blockchain architectures for drug traceability. We identify
   and discuss several open research challenges related to the application
   of blockchain technology for drug traceability. The proposed blockchain
   architectures provide a valuable roadmap for Health Informatics
   researchers to build and deploy an end-to-end solution for the
   pharmaceutical industry.},

Title = {A Cyber Secure Medical Management System by Using Blockchain},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS},
Abstract = {In the pharmaceutical industry, problems like counterfeit drugs,
   including vaccines, and their supply chain management problems like
   transparency, immutability, and traceability exist. In the case of
   vaccines, it becomes more difficult to standardize and detect fake
   vaccines because the public has less awareness and knowledge about
   vaccines. Moreover, the increase in online pharmacies gives more
   opportunities for counterfeiting vaccines to enter the authentic supply
   chain management system. We present transparent, immutable and secure
   vaccine supply chain (TISVSchain), a framework based on blockchain to
   handle the issues of counterfeited vaccines and vaccine supply chain
   problems like transparency, immutability, and traceability. Our proposed
   framework can run both on the private and public blockchain. We have
   implemented the framework on public blockchain by using remix ide and
   the smart contracts designed by solidity language run on very low gas
   cost. We also carried out several experiments by changing the number of
   nodes and their block time to evaluate the performance of our framework
   in terms of transaction per second (TPS), gas cost, and propagation
   delay. Our proposed framework improves the security by using offline
   unique account addresses in blockchain-based frameworks and improves the
   overall efficiency of the framework by keeping the gas cost low, finding
   a way to decrease the number of lost blocks to keep low propagation
   delay, and keeping high TPS value. TISVSchain shows us promising results
   to improve vaccine supply chain management's overall performance,
   security, and efficiency.},

Abstract = {Blockchain technology is one of the many disruptive technologies of the
   Fourth Industrial Revolution that will irrevocably change the way we
   live and work. These technologies are well embedded in the areas of
   global finance, health care and defence, to name a few. This review
   focuses on the relevance of blockchain technology to health care.
   Blockchain technology will be the unifying platform for sharing patient
   data currently inaccessible due to the siloed architecture of legacy
   software systems, and as a result potentially be the basis for precision
   or individualized patient treatment. It will also strengthen digital
   security of sensitive patient data that is presently a lucrative target
   for cyber criminals. In the current COVID-19 environment, clinicians
   will rely more on telehealth to reduce person-to-person contact. This
   service can be delivered by the clinical team with confidence in the
   veracity of the patient data made accessible through the blockchain
   platform. Smart contracts written on the blockchain platform will reduce
   the possibility of international humanitarian aid to low- and
   middle-income countries being misspent. The pharmaceutical supply chain
   industry is adopting blockchain technology to ensure supply chain
   provenance. Similarly, the health insurance industry recognizes how the
   blockchain ecosystem can improve services to its members and expedite
   reimbursements to clinicians.},

Abstract = {Blockchain is the technology that allows people to make transactions
   without intermediaries. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency launched.
   Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that can be used for transactions.
   They use cryptography to establish their authenticity and are not linked
   to a central authority. Blockchain has many advantages for the
   healthcare industry and can be used in various fields such as:
   implementation and improvement of electronic patient records, in
   clinical trials, neuroscience, pharmaceutical industry and research. Its
   security can help to improve the confidentiality of patient data and can
   also help secure the supply chain of medicines. The security and
   transparency of the blockchain will play a crucial role in the medical
   industry. This will allow companies to register their products and
   conduct secure transactions. QR codes can also be placed on the back of
   medicine containers to help customers identify the authenticity of the
   products they purchase. The exchange of health information through the
   blockchain will also have various challenges, such as maintaining the
   confidentiality of patient data. At the same time, due to the different
   regulations in different countries, it can be difficult to establish an
   efficient and secure exchange. Unlike other cryptocurrencies,
   blockchains are usually immutable, which means that the data added in
   the chain will always remain. This eliminates the risk of data loss.},

Title = {Assessing the feasibility of blockchain technology in industries:
   evidence from Turkey},

Abstract = {Purpose The objective of this study is to assess quantitatively how
   feasible blockchain is for various industries, such as logistics and
   supply chain, health, energy, finance, automotive, pharmaceutical and
   agriculture and food using a comprehensive list of indicators.
   Design/methodology/approach A decision aid was applied to the problem of
   identifying the feasibility of blockchain in Turkish industries. To this
   end, first, a set of indicators was identified. Then, the fuzzy AHP and
   fuzzy TOPSIS were utilized to assess the feasibility comparatively using
   the data gathered from a group of experts. Finally, a scenario analysis
   was conducted to ensure the consistency of our evaluation. Findings The
   findings of this study suggest that comparatively, logistics and supply
   chain, finance and health industries are the most feasible industries
   for blockchain. This study further suggests that blockchain is the least
   feasible for the automotive industry compared to the rest of the
   identified industries. Research limitations/implications It is
   cumbersome to find out the respondents who have sufficient knowledge of
   both blockchain and the identified industries. Even if we took the
   utmost care in identifying the right respondents, we limited our search
   to the biggest industrial hubs of Turkey. Practical implications The
   findings of this research may help various decision-makers employed in
   governments, conglomerates, software and consulting firms and national
   research institutions make more informed decisions and allocate their
   resources more effectively. Originality/value To this date, the current
   studies have solely investigated possible research opportunities in
   blockchain and demonstrated several blockchain applications in
   stand-alone cases. To the best of our knowledge, however, no single
   study exists that evaluates the feasibility of blockchain comparatively
   and holistically among a group of industries using various indicators.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in technology have drastically downsized costs and
   implementation times for genomic services. The wide availability of
   low-cost genomic technologies and easy access to genomic data can
   significantly improve healthcare productivity and efficiency, all to the
   benefit of social well-being in general. For example, by creating the
   conditions for researchers to identify the causes of multiple diseases
   and contributing to the development of new drugs, we can improve the
   quality of life and give people, as users of genomic services, the means
   to positively impact their health. This article describes how blockchain
   technology can lay the foundations of an ecosystem that encourages users
   to acquire and share their genomic data in full awareness without fear
   of being circumvented to participate in the benefits and advances in
   genomic research. The starting point is Genesy, an innovative blockchain
   platform that transcribes genomic data, thus facilitating and, at the
   same time safeguarding, the users of genomic services in their
   relationships with parties interested in accessing and using data they
   own, such as research centers, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and
   geneticists. This result is obtained by exploiting blockchain
   technology's capabilities to notarize data and prevent their
   unauthorized use, and at the same time to make them objects of possible
   transactions between different parties. Looking ahead, the Genesy model
   can be generalized to promote an ecosystem, and a fair market, for all
   types of biomedical data.},

Abstract = {Blockchain is a technology with potential for making ground breaking
   steps in addressing social, economic and healthcare challenges. The
   global information technology scene is being overcrowded with blockchain
   applications with special focus on the vast healthcare market {[}12].
   The value of information related to healthcare creates a clear path for
   applying blockchain as a solution for some of the challenges in the
   healthcare sector, in particular with the goal of creating a fair and
   transparent way for sharing information and patient data. It is however
   a fact that while blockchain technology introduces additional complexity
   to the implementation healthcare software, the benefit the technology
   actually brings still remains unclear and difficult to evaluate. This
   vision paper demonstrates our research focus on providing a body of
   knowledge and tools to help evaluate this impact of blockchain on
   eHealth applications. In particular, we identify that such a research
   effort has to explicitly consider cost of addressing challenges inherent
   to the eHealth domain like integration of disparate software systems
   (hospitals, research institutions, government agencies, health insurance
   and pharmaceutical companies, etc.), the potential introduction of
   cryptocurrencies in healthcare systems, degree of patient service
   improvement, transparency and compliance to laws and regulations, and
   others. The more traditional influencing factors, like cost of
   development and running, licenses for using third-party software
   services, and the ones inherent to blockchain like cost of computation
   and energy will also have to be taken into consideration in the metrics
   model.},

   Traceability Implementations},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, traceability systems have been developed as practical
   tools for improving supply chain (SC) transparency and visibility,
   especially in health and safety-sensitive sectors like food and
   pharmaceuticals. Blockchain-related SC traceability research has
   received significant attention during the last several years, and
   arguably blockchain is currently the most promising technology for
   providing traceability-related services in SC networks. This paper
   provides a systematic literature review of the various technical
   implementation aspects of blockchain-enabled SC traceability systems. We
   apply different drivers for classifying the selected literature, such as
   (a) the various domains of the available blockchain-enabled SC
   traceability systems and relevant methodologies applied; (b) the
   implementation maturity of these traceability systems along with
   technical implementation details; and (c) the sustainability perspective
   (economic, environmental, social) prevalent to these implementations. We
   provide key takeaways regarding the open issues and challenges of
   current blockchain traceability implementations and fruitful future
   research areas. Despite the significant volume and plethora of
   blockchain-enabled SC traceability systems, academia has so far focused
   on unstructured experimentation of blockchain-associated SC traceability
   solutions, and there is a clear need for developing and testing
   real-life traceability solutions, especially taking into account
   feasibility and cost-related SC aspects.},

Abstract = {Cold chains are temperature-controlled supply chains and have a high
   priority from the managerial point of view. The pharmaceutical cold
   chain, in particular, is a complex and sensitive chain that needs to be
   managed effectively based on its direct effects on public health and
   peoples' life. Blockchain technology as an emerging distributed solution
   has been attracting proliferating studies over recent years. The main
   objective of this paper is to address how blockchain would meet the
   requirements of a pharmaceutical cold chain such as pharmaceutical
   digital identity, serialization and traceability, data integrity,
   trans-parency, and waste management. Besides, we reviewed the current
   limitations of the blockchain-enabled pharmaceutical chain to provide
   deep insights into the existing research challenges and clarify future
   study directions. Moreover, different case studies of blockchain-based
   pharmaceutical and medicine projects that deal with these challenges for
   diverse purposes are discussed. This study represents the various
   solutions by which blockchain technology would help attain the
   pharmaceutical cold chain objectives.

Abstract = {In order to solve the problems of safety, trust, inefficiency and
   traceability of pharmaceutical products in pharmaceutical supply chain,
   a pharmaceutical supply chain management system based on IoT and
   blockchain has been designed and developed. To ensure the authenticity
   of data sources, IoT devices such as radio frequency identification
   (RFID), sensors, locators and QR codes are used to collect the current
   status of pharmaceutical products at anytime and anywhere. At the same
   time, with the help of the distributed ledger technology of blockchain,
   the system has realized the sharing and storage of data in each link of
   the supply chain, and ensures that the data are transparent, traceable
   and not tampered with. Finally, the permission control method based on
   the consortium blockchain was designed to meet the privacy and
   confidentiality requirements of some data. According to the results of
   functional tests, the system effectively improves the transparency of
   data in the supply chain, increases the safety of pharmaceutical
   products, and reduces manual operation, so members of the supply chain
   can benefit from a more open information.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a secure and transparent pharmaceutical supply chain
   system using a permissioned blockchain network. This work focuses on (i)
   Enhancing the security of origin information across the supply chain
   with proper identification and authentication among the supplier,
   distributor, and other members of the system, (ii) Secure storing of the
   Supply Drugs Information (SDI) in the blockchain in a distributed
   manner, (iii) Traceability and transparent sharing of information across
   supply chain system. This proposed work also performs automatic
   transactions between suppliers and the distributors, tracking the
   provenance, adequate verification, and reducing supply chains' risk. The
   proposed system has been implemented using Hyperledger fabric and
   evaluated using Hyperledger Calliper to test its performance. Finally,
   we analyzed the proposed work's performance in terms of throughput,
   transaction latency, and network load. The results have shown that
   better transaction processing power and security than other existing
   systems of the blockchain.},

Abstract = {The main issues with drug safety in the counterfeit medicine supply
   chain, are to do with how the drugs are initially manufactured. The
   traceability of right and active pharmaceutical ingredients during
   actual manufacture is a difficult process, so detecting drugs that do
   not contain the intended active ingredients can ultimately lead to
   end-consumer patient harm or even death. Blockchain's advanced features
   make it capable of providing a basis for complete traceability of drugs,
   from manufacturer to end consumer, and the ability to identify
   counterfeit-drug. This paper aims to address the issue of drug safety
   using Blockchain and encrypted QR(quick response) code security.},

Abstract = {Since the authentication of digital prescription is a lengthy and
   error-prone process by pharmacy employees, nowadays in many countries
   around the world, the paper-based prescription is still the only valid
   document for patients to purchase their prescribed medication from a
   pharmacy. Moreover, as a prescription can contain a lot of private
   information about the patients and their illness, the security and
   privacy issues in using digital prescription also raise big concerns.
   Recently, Blockchain has been widely regarded as a promising technology
   to secure online business data and transactions. In this paper, we
   present BlockMeds, a Blockchain based online prescription system which
   enables the authentication of digital prescriptions. Meanwhile, to
   address the privacy issue during the authentication and transaction for
   buying the medication, a privacy protection strategy is also implemented
   in the system. BlockMeds provides the proof of concept for a Blockchain
   based online prescription system. It also demonstrates the need for
   privacy protection which is often overlooked in a Blockchain-based
   system. BlockMeds can be used as a prototype system by both researchers
   and industrial practitioners who are interested in Blockchain-based
   medical service systems.},

Title = {A Blockchain Secured Pharmaceutical Distribution System to Fight
   Counterfeiting},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Counterfeiting drugs has been a global concern for years. Considering
   the lack of transparency within the current pharmaceutical distribution
   system, research has shown that blockchain technology is a promising
   solution for an improved supply chain system. This study aims to explore
   the current solution proposals for distribution systems using blockchain
   technology. Based on a literature review on currently proposed
   solutions, it is identified that the secrecy of the data within the
   system and nodes' reputation in decision making has not been considered.
   The proposed prototype uses a zero-knowledge proof protocol to ensure
   the integrity of the distributed data. It uses the Markov model to track
   each node's `reputation score' based on their interactions to predict
   the reliability of the nodes in consensus decision making. Analysis of
   the prototype demonstrates a reliable method in decision making, which
   concludes with overall improvements in the system's confidentiality,
   integrity, and availability. The result indicates that the decision
   protocol must be significantly considered in a reliable distribution
   system. It is recommended that the pharmaceutical distribution systems
   adopt a relevant protocol to design their blockchain solution.
   Continuous research is required further to increase performance and
   reliability within blockchain distribution systems.},

Abstract = {Blockchain technology has garnered attention from stakeholders in many
   domains, including healthcare, governance, and supply chain management.
   In the context of healthcare, traceability of pharmaceutical drugs in a
   transparent yet secure manner can be made faster and efficient with
   blockchain. This paper presents a blockchain-based solution for
   traceability known as PharmaChain. The traceability is achieved with
   application design and algorithms which are proposed in the work. The
   proposed application can be developed using hyperledger fabric deployed
   on dockers. The chain codes are written in javascript. The
   pharmaceutical blockchain proposed in this work consists of
   manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and consumer. The right for
   registering a drug into the blockchain is granted to the manufacturers
   only, and the ownership transfer of the drug is stored. This paper
   highlights the traceability of ownership transfer of the drug and
   validates its origin.},

Title = {BBTCD: blockchain based traceability of counterfeited drugs},
Journal = {HEALTH SERVICES AND OUTCOMES RESEARCH METHODOLOGY},
Abstract = {The supply chain is a complex network in healthcare that crosses
   organizational and geographical borders. The inherent complexity of such
   structures can introduce impurities inclusive of erroneous facts, lack
   of transparency, and restricted records provenance. In the healthcare
   business, counterfeit pills are one of the major reasons for the harmful
   impact on human health and also for financial losses. Thus,
   pharmaceutical supply chains and end-to-end tracking systems are the
   recent research in healthcare. In this paper, we propose blockchain
   based traceability of counterfeited drugs (BBTCD) that implements
   tracking of counterfeited drugs using smart contracts on the Ethereum
   blockchain. We propose a solution to fully decentralize the tracking in
   healthcare by storing BBTCD on IPFS (Inter Planetary File System) to
   provide transparency, cost-effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The growth in the use of blockchain technology in healthcare is
   remarkable and has a significant impact on the healthcare industry. In
   this work, the gap between the healthcare industry and blockchain
   technologies was addressed by evaluating previous activities.
   Bibliometric analysis of dataset distribution, venues, keywords and
   citations was conducted to identify the trend of blockchain technology
   in healthcare. Case studies of telecare medicine information system and
   E-health were also reviewed and evaluated in terms of security and
   privacy. This study discussed potential future challenges such as
   scalability and storage capacity, blockchain size, universal
   interoperability and standardisation. This work highlighted the
   motivations of employing blockchain technology in the healthcare
   industry. Prospects in health data and sharing process, clinical trials,
   the pharmaceutical industry, big data, artificial intelligence, 5 G
   ultrasonic device, security and privacy were highlighted.},

Abstract = {Blockchain technology is accelerating digital transformation across
   multiple industries, including the pharmaceutical industry. The
   pharmaceutical industry suffers from a lack of transparency, difficulty
   tracking products, lack of trust, and the shipment of expired products.
   Blockchain technology has been applied to solve several of these
   problems. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the
   literature focusing on the adoption of blockchain technology in the
   pharmaceutical industry. We collected, analyzed, qualified, and
   discussed studies retrieved from seven databases. The initial search
   yielded 2,185 papers, which were screened, discussed, voted on,
   critically appraised, and collected by a snowball workflow that finally
   yielded 38 papers. The blockchain application areas covered in the
   papers were classified as counterfeit drug prevention, drug
   distribution, tracking and tracing, and safety and security. The most
   frequent category was counterfeit drug prevention, which is consistent
   with the primary objective of the pharmaceutical industry. The newer
   topics discussed in this study were data governance, data quality,
   pharmaceutical turnover, and prescription drug monitoring. We discuss
   issues surrounding each of these topics and research studies, along with
   their limitations and solutions. We also examine the challenges and
   future research directions of applying blockchain technology in the
   pharmaceutical industry.},

Title = {Internet of Things (IoT)-blockchain-enabled pharmaceutical supply chain
   resilience in the post-pandemic era},
Journal = {FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, the current operating environment of
   pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) has rapidly changed and faced
   increasing risks of disruption. The Internet of Things (IoT) and
   blockchain not only help enhance the efficiency of PSC operations in the
   information technology domain but also address complex related issues
   and improve the visibility, flexibility, and transparency of these
   operations. Although IoT and blockchain have been widely examined in the
   areas of supply chain and logistics management, further work on PSC is
   expected by the public to enhance its resilience. To respond to this
   call, this paper combines a literature review with semi-structured
   interviews to investigate the characteristics of PSC, the key aspects
   affecting PSC, and the challenges faced by PSC in the post-pandemic era.
   An IoT-blockchain-integrated hospital-side oriented PSC management model
   is also developed. This paper highlights how IoT and blockchain
   technology can enhance supply chain resilience and provides a reference
   on how PSC members can cope with the associated risks.},

Title = {The benefits and threats of blockchain technology in healthcare: A
   scoping review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {142},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: The application of blockchain technology is being explored
   to improve the interoperability of patient health information between
   healthcare organisations while maintaining the privacy and security of
   data.
   Objectives: The objective of this scoping review is to explore and
   categorise the benefits and threats of blockchain technology application
   in a healthcare system.
   Methods: Databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, IEEE, Springer, and
   ScienceDirect were searched using a combination of terms related to
   blockchain, healthcare, benefits and threats. Backward-reference list
   checking was conducted to identify other relevant references. Study
   selection process was performed in three steps based on PRISMA flow
   diagram. Extracted data were synthesised and presented narratively using
   tables and figures.
   Results: The search resulted in 84 relevant studies that have been
   conducted of which only 37 unique studies were included in this review.
   Eight benefits of blockchain were categorised in either patient
   related-benefits (security and authorisation, personalised healthcare,
   patients' health data tracking, and patient's health status monitoring)
   or organisational-related benefits (health information exchange,
   pharmaceutical supply chain, clinical trials, and medical insurance
   management). Meanwhile, eight threats of blockchain were categorised
   into three groups: organisational threats (installation and transaction
   costs, interoperability issues, and lack of technical skills), social
   threats (social acceptance and regulations issues), and technological
   threats (scalability issues, authorisation and security issues, high
   energy consumption, and slow processing speeds).
   Conclusion: Blockchain is a viable technology that can improve the
   healthcare data sharing and storing system owing to its
   decentralisation, immutability, transparency and traceability features.
   However, many healthcare organisations remain hesitant to adopt
   blockchain technology due to threats such as security and authorisation
   issues, interoperability issues and lack of technical skills related to
   blockchain technology.},

Title = {Blockchain implementation in pharmaceutical supply chains: A review and
   conceptual framework},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Research on Blockchain implementation in the Pharmaceutical Supply
   Chains (PSC) is lacking despite its strong potential to overcome
   conventional supply chain challenges. Thus, this study aims to provide
   critical insight into the nexus between Blockchain and PSC and further
   build a conceptual framework for implementation within the
   pharmaceutical industry. Following a systematic literature review and
   text mining approach, 65 interdisciplinary articles published between
   2010 and 2021 were studied to capture the decade long developments.
   Descriptive and thematic analysis showcases nascent developments of
   Blockchain in PSC. The drivers and barriers to adoption, implementation
   stages, and applications identified through the thematic analysis guide
   in setting the agenda for future research, primarily focussing on the
   use of Blockchain for drug counterfeiting, recall issues, along with
   other sector-specific challenges such as patient privacy, regulations
   and clinical trials. Research on Blockchain for PSC has been slow
   compared to other sectors, but has accelerated since the Covid-19
   pandemic. Identified influential factors, implementation process and
   apparent applications are expected to influence researchers and
   practitioners in developing a roadmap for adopting Blockchain in the
   pharmaceutical industry. The proposed conceptual framework is novel and
   provides valuable directions to producers, regulators and governments to
   implement Blockchain in the pharmaceutical industry.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet and the Internet of Things,
   product recall, especially pharmaceutical recall, have attracted various
   stakeholders as a phase of product service. However, there are some the
   long-term problems on pharmaceutical recall, such as low effectiveness,
   seldom transparent, data can be tampered easily and so on. We have
   proposed a service system of pharmaceutical recall based on blockchain
   to solve these problems. The solution runs through the entire recall
   process that includes decision making, the OOS/OOT investigation, the
   action of working group and the Corrective and Preventative Action
   (CAPA). Through the management of recall, we are capable of shortening
   time, enhancing transparency and protecting the integrity of data in
   pharmaceutical recall. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Geospatial blockchain: promises, challenges, and scenarios in health and
   healthcare},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {A PubMed query run in June 2018 using the keyword `blockchain' retrieved
   40 indexed papers, a reflection of the growing interest in blockchain
   among the medical and healthcare research and practice communities.
   Blockchain's foundations of decentralisation, cryptographic security and
   immutability make it a strong contender in reshaping the healthcare
   landscape worldwide. Blockchain solutions are currently being explored
   for: (1) securing patient and provider identities; (2) managing
   pharmaceutical and medical device supply chains; (3) clinical research
   and data monetisation; (4) medical fraud detection; (5) public health
   surveillance; (6) enabling truly public and open geo-tagged data; (7)
   powering many Internet of Things-connected autonomous devices,
   wearables, drones and vehicles, via the distributed peer-to-peer apps
   they run, to deliver the full vision of smart healthy cities and
   regions; and (8) blockchain-enabled augmented reality in crisis mapping
   and recovery scenarios, including mechanisms for validating, crediting
   and rewarding crowdsourced geo-tagged data, among other emerging use
   cases. Geospatially-enabled blockchain solutions exist today that use a
   crypto-spatial coordinate system to add an immutable spatial context
   that regular blockchains lack. These geospatial blockchains do not just
   record an entry's specific time, but also require and validate its
   associated proof of location, allowing accurate spatiotemporal mapping
   of physical world events. Blockchain and distributed ledger technology
   face similar challenges as any other technology threatening to
   disintermediate legacy processes and commercial interests, namely the
   challenges of blockchain interoperability, security and privacy, as well
   as the need to find suitable and sustainable business models of
   implementation. Nevertheless, we expect blockchain technologies to get
   increasingly powerful and robust, as they become coupled with artificial
   intelligence (AI) in various real-word healthcare solutions involving
   AI-mediated data exchange on blockchains.},

Abstract = {At present, in China, the government plays a significant role in running
   the medicare system, while the commercial insurance acts as a supplement
   to it. With the aggravating trend of aging population, rising medical
   demands released from increasing health consciousness, and more
   occurrence of chronic diseases coming from the lifestyle change, as well
   as the medical technology progress, all these contribute the rapid rise
   of health care expense and the Medicare is under great pressure. As a
   result, the problem of inadequate and overly expensive medical services
   has become a hot topic.
   There is also unbalance in resource allocation in the social healthcare
   system, which can be attributed to the nature of insurance or
   healthcare, namely Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection. Still they are
   two unsolved questions. For example, it is common to see residents buy
   articles for daily use, cosmetics or heath products from designated
   pharmacies using their Medicare account. While many other people are
   unable to get timely and efficient treatment because they cannot afford
   it. What' s more, such abuse of Medicare also increases the operation
   cost of national healthcare system. Apart from Medicare, citizens could
   alternatively choose commercial insurance. Unfortunately, it is not a
   proper choice for the low-incomes. Therefore, it is important to find a
   way to solve this unbalance.
   According to the development of technology, Blockchain may well bring
   about a revolution in today's social medical insurance system.
   Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology based on the principles of
   peer-to-peer network and cryptographic primitives (such as hash,
   asymmetric encryption and digital signature). Due to its immutability,
   transparency, and trustworthiness for all transactions executed in a
   blockchain network, this innovative technology has many potential
   applications.
   Individuals, families, medical institutions and the government all play
   a part in the Medicare. To make the most of the healthcare system, we
   have to put individual demand and feelings at first place. Having access
   to a ledger-shared, immutable, and transparent history of all the
   actions performed by participants of the network (such as a patient
   modifying permissions, a doctor accessing or uploading new data like
   prescriptions) overcome the issues presented above. In other words,
   blockchain technology could solve the problem of Moral Hazard and
   Adverse Selection, which is aroused from asymmetric information. At the
   same time, based on a peer-to-peer medical insurance network, Medicare
   could allocate resources more efficiently. This paper tends to analyze
   problems of the current social medical system and discuss the potential
   applications of blockchain technology in this field. By innovatively
   putting forth an idea of `Medi-score', taking theories of insurance
   economics into account and discussing cases in other countries, we try
   to figure out a framework of our topic.},

Abstract = {Blockchain presents a promising and revolutionary technology for
   organizations' collaboration, particularly for Inter-Organizational
   Business Processes (IOBP). It addresses the lack-of-trust problem thanks
   to its transparency and decentralized features. However, while the
   adoption of Blockchain technology can alleviate some of IOBP's
   challenges, it does so at the expense of significant privacy issues. In
   fact, some process execution data, such as customers' data or business
   secrets, cannot be shared across the collaborating organizations owing
   to regulatory restrictions such as the General Data Protection
   Regulation (GDPR). To address trust and privacy issues in IOBP, this
   paper presents a Blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)
   approach. The SSI concept is combined with a registry proof smart
   contract to provide an efficient privacy-preserving solution. The
   proposed approach is applied to the pharmaceutical supply chain case
   study and implemented on the Ethereum Blockchain.},

Abstract = {Blockchain, an immutable ledger or database shared by peers in a
   network, is comprised of records of events or transactions that are
   appended chronologically. Introduced via Bitcoin to the world,
   blockchain is increasingly being accepted and adopted in different
   industries and for diverse use cases. Among key industries, health care
   offers several significant opportunities for applying blockchain
   conceptualization. Chief areas for health care blockchain applications
   include electronic medical records management, pharmaceutical supply
   chain management, biomedical research and education, remote patient
   monitoring, health insurance claim processing, and health data
   analytics. Even so, applying blockchain concepts in health care is not
   without challenges, including interoperability, security-privacy,
   scalability-speed, and stakeholders' engagement issues. While these
   challenges may militate against blockchain applications in health care,
   there are possible countermeasures and implementation techniques, which
   if adhered to, can reasonably contain many aspects of such challenges.},

Abstract = {Leading experts from academic, industrial and policy-making circles
   describe Blockchain as a disruptive and game changing technology across
   various sectors. However, the question, whether Blockchain does already
   have the properties of a General Purpose Technology (GPT) and, as such,
   will determine macroeconomic dynamics in the next decades, has been
   disregarded in the academic literature. This paper covers the research
   gap by systematically revealing the acknowledged features of a GPT -
   pervasiveness, innovation spawning effects and scope for improvement -
   in the newest available Blockchain-related patent data from PATSTAT. To
   gain insights about pervasiveness, (1) a generality index of Blockchain
   is compared to respective values of co-existing technologies usually
   considered (information and communication technology) and not considered
   (pharmaceutical technology) GPTs. The second feature, innovation
   spawning is dissected (2) analyzing variety of innovators patenting in
   Blockchain domain and (3) looking at firms' behavior in terms of entry
   and exit in line with industrial dynamics. (4) Investigation of
   evolution patterns of Blockchain patents provides insights about its
   scope for improvement. The empirical analysis advances the claim that
   Blockchain does already represent a GPT in the making and, therefore,
   has a potential to shape a technological era and cause substantial
   changes in the economic, social and institutional structures.},

Abstract = {Pharmaceutical drugs are essential in diagnosing and treating patients.
   However, over the past decade, the issue of fraud and abuse drugs in the
   pharmaceutical supply chain has become increasingly apparent. To solve
   these problems, a transformation of the current pharmaceutical supply
   chain to include tracking technologies, from the source of the
   ingredients to the consumer, is recommended. In this paper, we
   investigate the novel pharmaceutical governance based on IoT and
   Blockchain technology. Internet of Things (IoT) based blockchain is a
   type of distributed ledger (DLT) that maintains an immutable record of
   all transaction information that is incapable of being falsified and is
   visible to all participants. Implementing an IoT-based blockchain system
   would provide the tools for the pharmaceutical industry to improve drug
   governance along the supply chain, thus making healthcare more efficient
   and reliable.},

Abstract = {Blockchain is a new trend rising fast from the community and the
   enterprise world. As an infrastructural technology it is finding its way
   into a growing number of domains like finance, medical, digital
   marketplace, pharmaceutical and government agencies. While blockchain
   technology is primarily thought as the foundation of Bitcoin, it has
   grown far beyond underpinning the virtual currency. It promises building
   better trust, transparency, and integrity without a third-party and the
   risk of censorship. These remarkable advantages do however come at a
   price. The blockchain ecosystem is riddled with human-centric and
   economical issues for its participants, leading to unintended
   consequences in decentralized networks. Gamified software engineering is
   a growing field that in particular taps into gamification technology,
   the application of game mechanics in non-game contexts, to address
   human-related concerns. There are currently no studies around blockchain
   that have been identified to have a clear view of existing research and
   solutions for utilizing the gamification in the emerging blockchain
   systems. As a first step towards filling this gap, this paper discusses
   and identifies two major human-based problems in the blockchain
   decentralized applications and development. For those problems, it
   proposes a preliminary gamified model to provide a basis for expanding
   future research and applications in this joint domain.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there have been many problems in information
   integration among key pharmaceutical supply chain players in Saudi
   Arabia. This issue has resulted in problems such as medication shortage,
   lack of coordination among healthcare stakeholders, product wastage, and
   lack of demand information. However, blockchain, as a distributed
   digital ledger technology which ensures transparency, traceability, and
   security, is showing promise for easing some supply chain management
   problems. Local and global government, community, and consumer pressures
   to meet sustainability goals prompt us to further investigate how
   blockchain can address and promote supply chain sustainability. This
   study aims to explore the impact of blockchain technology implementation
   on the sustainability of the pharmaceutical supply chain. The objectives
   of this study are to identify the current information system
   infrastructure in the pharmaceutical supply chain of Saudi Arabia; to
   examine the barriers and challenges of blockchain adoption; and to
   examine the barriers and challenges of blockchain implementation. The
   result of this research is expected to contribute to the explore the
   role of blockchain in sustainability efforts. In addition, it will help
   managers, practitioners, consultants and decision makers who are
   interested in a deeper understanding of blockchain and its
   implementation and will evaluate its influence on sustainable supply
   chain management.},

Abstract = {Supply chain management in healthcare sector plays significant role in
   the lives of people. Presence of intermediaries and lack of traceability
   has lured it towards drug counterfeiting, which reduces drug efficacy,
   thus hampering patients' trust and putting their lives in danger.
   Blockchain has emerged as a groundbreaking technology which provide a
   system that is immutable and transparent without the requirement of a
   trusted third party. This paper depicts how blockchain can provide a
   solution to reduce drug counterfeit in the pharmaceutical supply chain.
   This is achieved by creating a Blockchain Network in which each
   participant and the drug is registered to maintain transparency of
   transactions among all the participants. Realtime transfer of ownership
   in the blockchain creates all-round visibility among the registered
   participants to retrieve information like the current owner, timestamp
   of ownership transfer and authenticity of drugs. This paper implements
   PharmaChain for real-time traceability and trackability information of
   drugs from end-to-end of the pharmaceutical supply chain.},

Abstract = {This research explores how the supply chain application of blockchain
   impacts workflow across organizations to encourage value-creating
   opportunities by modeling the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. It
   focuses on 1) identifying the critical factors that could generate
   additional value by using blockchain in the supply chain workflow, 2)
   implementing a vaccine logistics scenario on a blockchain platform, and
   3) examining the value creation and value appropriation opportunities
   resulting from embedding blockchain onto the supply chain. This study,
   which is currently in progress, demonstrates the practical benefits and
   business implications for applying blockchain in an urgent vaccine
   distribution environment.},

Abstract = {The pharmaceutical industry has many complex and strict environmental
   control processes to ensure authentic drug quality control and
   regulatory compliance throughout the supply chain of medical products.
   Despite the huge effort made by pharmaceutical firms, the drug
   counterfeiting is still an ongoing and complicated issue, which has
   caused important economic losses and impacted patient health. To
   eradicate this problematic, the pharma companies should lead a deep
   digital transformation of the pharmaceutical supply chain by including
   track and trace technology from the first supplier of the Raw \& Pack
   materials to the patients. This paper investigates blockchain-based
   technology, which is revolutionizing the pharma supply chain activities
   and leading to a transparent, reliable and authentic ecosystem. To reach
   this objective, we examined the advantage of introducing blockchain
   technology on serialization concept and track \& trace process. In
   addition, the paper analyses the integration of the blockchain with the
   ERP system.},

Title = {Blockchain Medledger: Hyperledger fabric enabled drug traceability
   system for counterfeit drugs in pharmaceutical industry},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {597},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Counterfeit drugs are one of the most severe threats to the
   pharmaceutical industry. World Health Organization (WHO) highlights that
   nearly 1035\% of the drugs, i.e., one out of ten medicines produced in
   the least developing countries, are counterfeit and have serious side
   effects on human lives. The upsurge in online and Internet-based
   pharmacies has made the safety and security of the drug supply chain
   process more intricate and complicated. This research proposes a new and
   novel track and trace blockchain-enabled Medledger system that leverages
   the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform using chaincodes (smart
   contracts). The proposed Medledger system helps to efficiently and
   securely execute drug supply chain transactions in a fabric enabled
   private permissioned distributed network of different pharmaceutical
   stakeholders. Our proposed traceability solution diminishes the need for
   a trusted centralized authority, intermediaries and provides transaction
   records, enhancing efficiency and safety with high integrity,
   reliability, and security that reduces the likelihood of meddling with
   stored data on the Medledger. Chaincodes are designed, coded, and
   implemented using sequence diagrams to govern and control the
   interaction amongst the participating stakeholders in the drug supply
   chain ecosystem. The proposed system perpetually stores and records all
   activities, events, and transactions on the blockchain's immutable
   Medledger linked with peer-to-peer decentralized file systems such as
   IPFS, Swarm, filecoin, etc. for storing and providing maximum
   transparency and traceability. We provide an insight into some of the
   ongoing implementation challenges for the hyperledger fabric platform.
   Finally, we discuss open challenges that serve as future research
   directions to improve the drug traceability solutions further.},

Title = {Blockchain-Based Verifiable Tracking of Resellable Returned Drugs},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {205848-205862},
Abstract = {An enormous amount of drug supply is regularly wasted due to several
   reasons related to incorrect prescription, purchase of unnecessary
   quantities, drug intolerance, allergy, or interactions. On the other
   hand, these medicines may be needed by patients who cannot afford to
   purchase them. To address this challenge, we propose a fully
   decentralized solution that governs the return and redistribution of
   unused drugs that are fit for usage. Our approach exploits the
   decentralized blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized
   storage systems such as the Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS). We
   develop a system that provides the ability for customers as well as
   pharmacies to return re-usable, resellable drugs for donation or resale
   at a lower price. The proposed scheme tracks the production of drugs
   from manufacturers to traders that subsequently sell them to customers.
   Unused drugs can be returned after approval by specialized entities and
   then redistributed. In particular, we present the decentralized system
   architecture and implement a prototype on a test Ethereum blockchain
   platform to present the suggested workflow. Further, we provide system
   evaluation focused on assessing system functionality, performance,
   execution cost, and security of smart contracts and their robustness. We
   have also made our smart contracts code publicly available on Github.

Abstract = {Recently, one of the most challenging problems has been considered about
   the purity of drug or drug safety. This issue has a significant impact
   in various fields related to medicine, especially in the pharmaceutical
   industry's commercial area. It takes thousands of lives per year for
   fake drugs to be delivered and consumed. There are no successful
   approaches to handling the network of the phony medicine syndicate
   globally, and the stakeholders in the drug industry have to act under
   authentication among them. This paper focuses on explaining an approach
   to resolve the issue of counterfeit drugs by using Blockchain
   technology. Further, Blockchain is a distributed system where each node
   holds the same data and aligns with other nodes without worrying about
   losing data. The suggested approach is based on storing the drug
   distribution criteria from medicine manufacturing to the consumer on the
   Blockchain network. The effect of a medicine on a patient will be
   recorded in a database for future statistics. For keeping transaction
   records, an approved Blockchain will be applied, and only trusted people
   will be able to access the system and push data to the Blockchain.},

Abstract = {The scale and severity of the opioid epidemic call for innovative,
   multipronged solutions. Research and development is key to accelerate
   the discovery and evaluation of interventions that support pain and
   substance use disorder management. In parallel, the use and integration
   of blockchain technology within research networks holds the potential to
   address some of the unique challenges facing opioid research. This paper
   discusses the applications of blockchain technology and illustrates
   potential ways in which it could be applied to strengthen the validity
   of outcomes research on the opioid epidemic. We reviewed published and
   gray literature to identify useful applications of blockchain,
   specifically those that address the challenges faced by opioid research
   networks and programs. We then convened a panel of experts to discuss
   the strengths, limitations, and feasibility of each application.
   Blockchain has the potential to address some of the issues surrounding
   health data management, including data availability, data sharing and
   interoperability, and privacy and security. We identified five primary
   applications of blockchain to opioids: clinical trials and
   pharmaceutical research, incentivizing data donation and behavior
   change, secure exchange and management of e-prescriptions, supply chain
   management, and secondary use of clinical data for research and public
   health surveillance. The published literature was limited, leading us to
   rely on gray literature, which was also limited in its discussion of the
   technical aspects of implementation. The technical expert panel provided
   additional context and an assessment of feasibility that was lacking in
   the literature. Research on opioid use and misuse is challenging because
   of disparate data stored across different systems, data and system
   interoperability issues, and legal requirements. These areas must be
   navigated to make data accessible, timely, and useful to researchers.
   Blockchain technologies have the potential to act as a facilitator in
   this process, offering a more efficient, secure, and privacy-preserving
   solution for data exchange. Among the 5 primary applications, we found
   that clinical trial research, supply chain management, and secondary use
   of data had the most examples in practice and the potential
   effectiveness of blockchain. More discussions and studies should focus
   on addressing technical questions concerning scalability and tackling
   practical concerns such as cost, standards, and governance around the
   implementation of blockchain in health care. Policy concerns related to
   balancing the need for data accessibility that also protects patient
   privacy and autonomy in revoking consent should also be examined.},

Abstract = {An interesting research problem in our age of Big Data is that of
   determining provenance. Granular evaluation of provenance of physical
   goods (e.g., tracking ingredients of a pharmaceutical or demonstrating
   authenticity of luxury goods) has often not been possible with today's
   items that are produced and transported in complex, interorganizational,
   often internationally spanning supply chains. Recent adoptions of the
   Internet of Things and blockchain technologies give promise at better
   supply-chain provenance. We are particularly interested in the
   blockchain, as many favored use cases of blockchain are for provenance
   tracking. We are also interested in applying ontologies, as there has
   been some work done on knowledge provenance, traceability, and food
   provenance using ontologies. In this paper, we make a case for why
   ontologies can contribute to blockchain design. To support this case, we
   analyze a traceability ontology and translate some of its
   representations to smart contracts that execute a provenance trace and
   enforce traceability constraints on the Ethereum blockchain platform.},

Abstract = {Medical data sharing, anti-tampering, and leakage prevention have always
   been severe problems that plagued the pharmaceutical industry. When a
   patient is referred, he often cannot provide information about previous
   visits because the medical information of each hospital cannot be shared
   in most cases, but only through Medical records, test sheets, and other
   easily lost paper information are used to share some medical
   information. At the same time, patient medical information is easily
   leaked, and the medical information provided in the event of a medical
   dispute cannot guarantee authenticity and impartiality. This article
   designs a consortium medical blockchain system based on a Possible
   Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm. This system is a medical system
   that is maintained and shared by multiple nodes and can prevent medical
   data from being tampered with or leaked. It can be used to solve these
   medical problems. Compared with the existing medical blockchain system,
   this system has certain advantages and better applicability.},

Abstract = {Background:Timely sharing of electronic health records across providers,
   while ensuring data security and privacy, is essential for prompt care
   of cancer patients, as well as for the development of medical research
   and the enhancement of personalized medicine. Yet, it is not trivial to
   achieve efficient consent management, data exchange, and access-control
   policy enforcement, in particular, in decentralized settings, and given
   the gravity of the condition such as cancer. Using blockchain technology
   (BCT) has been recently advocated by research communities and gained
   momentum from the industry perspective. However, most of the proposed
   solutions are at the level of a prototype, and blockchain-based
   healthcare data management systems are not in place yet.Summary:This
   paper presents a systematic literature review, aiming to analyze the
   motivations, advantages, and limitations, as well as barriers and future
   challenges faced when applying the state-of-the-art distributed ledger
   technology in oncology. We then discuss its outcomes and propose the
   direction of the future research that can help to attain integration and
   adoption of the BCT for data-sharing, medical research, and the
   pharmaceutical supply chain in oncology, as well as in healthcare in
   general.Key Messages:BCT has the potential to enhance data-sharing (for
   primary care and medical research), as well as to attain optimization of
   the pharmaceutical supply chain by bringing properties such as
   transparency, traceability, and immutability to the applications.
   However, BCT itself cannot guarantee data privacy and security. Thus, it
   is never proposed as a stand-alone technology, but as a combined
   technology with cryptographic techniques. Regardless of the number of
   existing prototypes of blockchain-based healthcare systems, due to the
   existing barriers of the adoption (e.g., legal, social, and
   technological limitations), there is a lack of evaluation in real-world
   settings. Aiming to overcome these limitations, we propose future
   research directions that include design of the privacy-preserving hybrid
   data storage, interoperable infrastructures and architecture, and are
   compliant with the international laws and regulations.},

Abstract = {Research and development of novel molecular compounds in the
   pharmaceutical industry can be highly costly. Lack of confidentiality
   can prevent a product from being patented or commercialized. As an
   effect, cross-organizational collaboration is virtually non-existent. In
   this paper, we introduce a blockchain-based solution to the
   collaborative drug discovery problem so that participants can maintain
   full ownership of the asset and upload partial information about
   molecules without revealing the molecule itself. A prototype is also
   implemented using the blockchain technology Hyperledger Fabric and
   analyzed from security and performance perspectives. The prototype
   provides a set of functionalities that makes sure that ownership is
   maintained, integrity is protected, and critical information remains
   confidential. From a performance perspective, it provides a good
   throughput and latency in the order of milliseconds. However, further
   improvements could be done to the scalability of the system.},

Abstract = {The global pharmaceutical industry has gone through several changes in
   the past decade related to the adoption of new technologies. The
   challenges that are faced by this industry mostly involve counterfeit
   drugs and operational issues. The involvement of cold chain for
   vaccines, medicine etc. is also impacting the secure logistics and
   transportation. Newly introduce blockchain technologies have
   capabilities to address these issues. The challenge which needs to
   address is the requirement of tracking the product authenticity from
   start production to consumption point to prevent further financial
   losses. The present study has proposed the investigation and assessment
   of blockchain for integration in the supply chain model of the
   pharmaceutical to securely record transactions between parties enhancing
   trust and transparency. The blockchain adaptation and implementation to
   address the supply chain challenges are discussed. (c) 2021 Elsevier

Abstract = {Blockchain technology opens up new opportunities for Business Process
   Management. This is mainly due to its unprecedented capability to let
   transactions be automatically executed and recorded by Smart Contracts
   in multi-peer environments, in a decentralised fashion and without
   central authoritative players to govern the workflow. In this way,
   blockchains also provide traceability. Traceability of information plays
   a pivotal role particularly in those supply chains where multiple
   parties are involved and rigorous criteria must be fulfilled to lead to
   a successful outcome. In this paper, we investigate how to run a
   business process in the context of a supply chain on a blockchain
   infrastructure so as to provide full traceability of its run-time
   enactment. Our approach retrieves information to trace process instances
   execution solely from the transactions written on-chain. To do so,
   hash-codes are reverse-engineered based on the Solidity Smart Contract
   encoding of the generating process. We show the results of our
   investigation by means of an implemented software prototype, with a case
   study on the reportedly challenging context of the pharmaceutical supply
   chain.},

Title = {Blockchain-based solution for Pharma Supply Chain Industry},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {177},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Modern pharma supply chain systems are complicated, involving
   manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers that span across continents. To
   date, there is a considerable lack of transparency in the movement and
   sale of pharmaceutical products sold online. Lack of transparency,
   mistrust in collaboration, and unwillingness to share data can be huge
   challenges for this global industry. In this paper, we propose a
   blockchain-based framework for the online sale of pharma products, in a
   decentralized manner with no intermeies such as hospitals or pharmacies.
   The proposed solution is based on utilizing Ethereum smart contracts, to
   monitor the interaction between participants, trigger events that are
   logged to help the participants to keep track and be informed about sale
   transactions, and ensure payment dispersal securely. In addition, smart
   contracts regulate the interaction between sellers and consumers by
   monitoring the status of IoT containers, including pharmaceuticals, and
   fully notifying consumers. Our smart contracts handle special cases
   related to consumer refunds in case of breach of contract terms to
   ensure the safe delivery of medicines.},

Abstract = {Purpose Blockchain has been considered a disrupting technology that can
   add value in various supply chains differently. The provenance framework
   matches the four blockchain capabilities of traceability,
   certifiability, trackability and verifiability to the five generic
   risks, namely, the financial risk, psychological risk, social risk,
   physical risk and performance risk. This will help in uncording which
   specific risk gets mitigated by the use of blockchain in a specific
   supply chain. Design/methodology/approach This study illustrates four
   supply chains, namely, pharmaceutical industry, fast moving consumer
   goods industry, precious metal and automotive industry, and maps the
   risks associated with them to the provenance framework wherein the
   applicability of blockchain is mapped. Fuzzy analytical hierarchical
   processing (F-AHP) is used to rank the risks in the supply chain.
   Findings Blockchain capabilities can elevate the provenance knowledge
   leading to assurance in terms of origin, authenticity, custody and
   integrity to mitigate the supply chain risks. Present work highlights
   the thrust areas across various supply chains and identifies the risk
   priority tasks aligning the contextual supply chain risks. This study
   has covered five major risk perceptions. This study contributes to the
   literature on blockchain, customer perceived risk, provenance and supply
   chain. Practical implications This methodology can be adopted to
   understand and market the application of blockchain in a supply chain.
   It brings the marketers and marketing perspective to the supply chain.
   Exhaustive risk perception can be included to get more comprehensive
   data on mapping the risks along different supply chains. Vertical
   extensions of this work can be consideration of other supply chains
   including dairy, fruits and vegetables, electronics and component
   assemblies to derive the comprehensive framework for mapping risk
   perceptions and thereby supply chain risk mitigation through blockchain
   technology. Originality/value This linkage between blockchain, perceived
   risk, applications in the supply chain and a tool to convince the
   customers about the blockchain applicability has not been discussed in
   the literature. Adopting the multi-criteria decision-making F-AHP
   approach, this study attempt to rank the risks and stimulate
   conversations around a common framework for multiple sectors.},

Title = {EdgeMediChain: A Hybrid Edge Blockchain-Based Framework for Health Data
   Exchange},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {113467-113486},
Abstract = {Recently, researchers around the world in medical institutions and
   pharmaceutical companies are demanding a wider access to healthcare data
   for secondary use in order to provide enhanced and personalized medical
   services. For this purpose, healthcare information exchange between
   health authorities can be leveraged as a fundamental concept to meet
   these demands and enable the discovery of new insights and cures.
   However, health data are highly sensitive and private information that
   requires strong authentication and authorization procedures to manage
   the access to them. In this regard, the cloud paradigm has been used in
   these e-healthcare solutions, but they remain inefficient due to their
   inability to adapt to the expanding volume of data generated from body
   sensors and their vulnerability against cyberattacks. Hence,
   collaborative and distributed data governance supported by edge
   computing and blockchain promises enormous potentials in improving the
   performance and security of the whole system. In this paper, we present
   a secure and efficient data management framework, named
   ``EdgeMediChain{''}, for sharing health data. The proposed architecture
   leverages both edge computing and blockchain to facilitate and provide
   the necessary requirements for a healthcare ecosystem in terms of
   scalability, security, as well as privacy. The Ethereum-based testbed
   evaluations show the effectiveness of EdgeMediChainin terms of execution
   time with a reduction of nearly 84.75\% for 2000 concurrent
   transactions, higher throughput compared to a traditional blockchain,
   and scalable ledger storage with a linear growth rate.},

Abstract = {In the growth of the Pharmacy industry, the automation of smart
   traceability system is needed to prevent the fraud attempt. The proposed
   Blockchain integrated Internet of Things (BIoT) is constructed to
   provide the security in the industry by developing the Pharmaceutical
   traceability system which is capable of increasing the security and
   prevent the fraud attempts. The proposed system maintains the
   authentication, confidentiality and improves the data sharing and
   storage management in an efficient way. The monitoring system is
   developed to ensure the quality level of the traceability system with
   risk analysis and surveillance using the sensor network for
   communication. The performance analysis proves that the proposed system
   has improved performance compared to the other related techniques.},

   Counterfeit Pharmaceutical Prevention},
Journal = {SENSORS},

Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The top priority of today's healthcare system is delivering medicine
   directly from the manufacturer to end-user. The pharmaceutical supply
   chain involves some level of commingling of a collection of stakeholders
   such as distributors, manufacturers, wholesalers, and customers. The
   biggest challenge associated with this supply chain is temperature
   monitoring as well as counterfeit drug prevention. Many drugs and
   vaccines remain viable within a specific range of temperatures. If
   exposed beyond this temperature range, the medicine no longer works as
   intended. In this paper, an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor-based
   blockchain framework is proposed that tracks and traces drugs as they
   pass slowly through the entire supply chain. On the one hand, these new
   technologies of blockchain and IoT sensors play an essential role in
   supply chain management. On the other hand, they also pose new
   challenges of security for resource-constrained IoT devices and
   blockchain scalability issues to handle this IoT sensor-based
   information. In this paper, our primary focus is on improving classic
   blockchain systems to make it suitable for IoT based supply chain
   management, and as a secondary focus, applying these new promising
   technologies to enable a viable smart healthcare ecosystem through a
   drug supply chain.},

Title = {Blockchain Applications in Health Care and Public Health: Increased
   Transparency},

Abstract = {Background: Although big data and smart technologies allow for the
   development of precision medicine and predictive models in health care,
   there are still several challenges that need to be addressed before the
   full potential of these data can be realized (eg, data sharing and
   interoperability issues, lack of massive genomic data sets, data
   ownership, and security and privacy of health data). Health companies
   are exploring the use of blockchain, a tamperproof and distributed
   digital ledger, to address some of these challenges.
   Objective: In this viewpoint, we aim to obtain an overview of blockchain
   solutions that aim to solve challenges in health care from an industry
   perspective, focusing on solutions developed by health and technology
   companies.
   Methods: We conducted a literature review following the protocol defined
   by Levac et al to analyze the findings in a systematic manner. In
   addition to traditional databases such as IEEE and PubMed, we included
   search and news outlets such as CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, and Medium.
   Results: Health care companies are using blockchain to improve
   challenges in five key areas. For electronic health records, blockchain
   can help to mitigate interoperability and data sharing in the industry
   by creating an overarching mechanism to link disparate personal records
   and can stimulate data sharing by connecting owners and buyers directly.
   For the drug (and food) supply chain, blockchain can provide an
   auditable log of a product's provenance and transportation (including
   information on the conditions in which the product was transported),
   increasing transparency and eliminating counterfeit products in the
   supply chain. For health insurance, blockchain can facilitate the claims
   management process and help users to calculate medical and
   pharmaceutical benefits. For genomics, by connecting data buyers and
   owners directly, blockchain can offer a secure and auditable way of
   sharing genomic data, increasing their availability. For consent
   management, as all participants in a blockchain network view an
   immutable version of the truth, blockchain can provide an immutable and
   timestamped log of consent, increasing transparency in the consent
   management process.
   Conclusions: Blockchain technology can improve several challenges faced
   by the health care industry. However, companies must evaluate how the
   features of blockchain can affect their systems (eg, the append-only
   nature of blockchain limits the deletion of data stored in the network,
   and distributed systems, although more secure, are less efficient).
   Although these trade-offs need to be considered when viewing blockchain
   solutions, the technology has the potential to optimize processes,
   minimize inefficiencies, and increase trust in all contexts covered in
   this viewpoint.},

Title = {Blockchain-Based Processing of Health Insurance Claims for Prescription
   Drugs},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {118093-118107},
Abstract = {The current legacy system used in processing health insurance claims
   causes a huge amount of financial loss every year due to fraud claims.
   It is also highly prone to privacy and security threats due to the use
   of traditional methods. Health insurance claims for prescription drugs
   are one such claim that is highly prone to being tampered with. Also,
   there is a lack of linkage in the prescription data between the medical
   care provider and the pharmacy, which also leads to miscommunication and
   the use of false prescriptions. In this paper, we propose processing
   health insurance claims for drug prescriptions using blockchain
   technology that manages the processing of prescription drugs in a
   private, secure, trustworthy, and decentralized manner. The proposed
   system utilizes a private Ethereum blockchain. The system includes two
   smart contracts: registration and approval smart contracts, which
   provide traceability and trustworthiness to the system. The system was
   integrated with off-chain storage (IPFS) and a fronted decentralized
   applications (DApps), which improves the accessibility of centralized
   patient information by authorized parties. To maintain the privacy of
   the data, a gateway is used to filter the data that can be viewed by the
   participants. We present the system architecture, sequence diagrams,
   entity-relationship diagram, and algorithms to demonstrate the working
   principles of the proposed process for processing health insurance
   claims for prescription drugs using blockchain. The performance of the
   proposed solution is evaluated by conducting security analysis and
   comparing it to the existing solutions. Our smart contract code is
   publicly available on GitHub.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is the novel paradigm of connectivity and
   the driving force behind state-of-the-art applications and services.
   However, the exponential growth of the number of IoT devices and
   services, their distributed nature, and scarcity of resources has
   increased the number of security and privacy concerns ranging from the
   risks of unauthorized data alterations to the potential discrimination
   enabled by data analytics over sensitive information. Thus, a blockchain
   based IoT-platform is introduced to address these issues. Built upon the
   tamper-proof architecture, the proposed access management mechanisms
   ensure the authenticity and integrity of data. Moreover, a novel
   approach called Block Analytics Tool (BAT), integrated with the platform
   is proposed to analyze and make predictions on data stored on the
   blockchain. BAT enables the data-analysis applications to be developed
   using the data stored in the platform in an optimized manner acting as
   an interface to off-chain processing. A pharmaceutical supply chain is
   used as the use case scenario to show the functionality of the proposed
   platform. Furthermore, a model to forecast the demand of the
   pharmaceutical drugs is investigated using a real-world data set to
   demonstrate the functionality of BAT. Finally, the performance of BAT
   integrated with the platform is evaluated.},

Abstract = {Health insurance provides economic coverage and medical assistance to
   its members. For this, the collaboration of several entities is
   necessary, such as: the insured party, the insurer and health service
   providers (medical center and pharmacy). A set of rules generates a flow
   of information from two activities: policy issuance and claims
   management. However, these have the following drawbacks: human
   supervision errors and lack of access for data visibility. Given these
   challenges, this document describes how the characteristics of
   blockchain-based smart contracts can support these tasks without
   requiring trusted third parties. For this, a model and layered overview
   are described using smart contracts. Conclusions and future work are
   explained at the end of the document.},

Abstract = {Due to the rapid increase in environmental degradation and depletion of
   natural resources, the focus of researchers is shifted from economic to
   socio-environmental problems. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that
   has the potential to restructure the entire supply chain for sustainable
   practices. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that provides a digital
   database for recording all the transactions of the supply chain. The
   main purpose of this research is to explore the literature relevant to
   blockchain for sustainable supply chain management. The focus of this
   review is on the sustainability of the blockchain-based supply chain
   concerning environmental conservation, social equality, and governance
   effectiveness. Using a systematic literature review, a total of 136
   articles were evaluated and categorized according to the triple
   bottom-line aspects of sustainability. Challenges and barriers during
   blockchain adoption in different industrial sectors such as aviation,
   shipping, agriculture and food, manufacturing, automotive,
   pharmaceutical, and textile industries were critically examined. This
   study has not only explored the economic, environmental, and social
   impacts of blockchain but also highlighted the emerging trends in a
   circular supply chain with current developments of advanced technologies
   along with their critical success factors. Furthermore, research areas
   and gaps in the existing research are discussed, and future research
   directions are suggested. The findings of this study show that
   blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the entire supply chain
   from a sustainability perspective. Blockchain will not only improve the
   economic sustainability of the supply chain through effective
   traceability, enhanced visibility through information sharing,
   transparency in processes, and decentralization of the entire structure
   but also will help in achieving environmental and social sustainability
   through resource efficiency, accountability, smart contracts, trust
   development, and fraud prevention. The study will be helpful for
   managers and practitioners to understand the procedure of blockchain
   adoption and to increase the probability of its successful
   implementation to develop a sustainable supply chain network.},

Abstract = {The globalization of the pharmaceutical supply chain has lead to new
   challenges, the leading position among them is the fight against
   falsified and substandard pharmaceutical products. Such kind of products
   causes ineffective or harmful therapies all over the world. Traditional
   centralized technical tools can hardly satisfy the requirements of the
   changing industry. In this paper, we research the application of
   Blockchain solutions to modernize the drug supply chain and minimize the
   amount of the poor-quality medications.},

Title = {Towards blockchain-based hospital waste management systems; applications
   and future trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {349},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Effective hospital waste management (HWM) has become a significant
   environmental and green healthcare domain issue. In this regard, recent
   outstanding technological advances in artificial intelligence, the
   Internet of Things, and blockchain technology have made significant
   contributions in solving environmental challenges. This study aims to
   address how blockchain technology would meet the requirements of HWM.
   Hence, a comprehensive systematic literature review is done to identify
   and critically appraise blockchain applications in the field of study.
   These applications are classified into waste generation, waste
   separation and packaging, waste storage containers, waste collection,
   temporary waste storage area, waste treatment, off-site and on-site
   transport of waste, waste disposal, hospital staffs training, waste
   management regulations, hospital sewage system, energy, and waste
   recycling and reuse. Moreover, each cluster's current limitations and
   challenges to enlighten the existing research gaps and clarify future
   trends are addressed. The findings of this study would be helpful for
   researchers interested in green healthcare, specifically drug,
   pharmaceutical, and HWM and related fields.},

Title = {Blockchain based secured information sharing protocol in supply chain
   management system with key distribution mechanism},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},

Abstract = {The concept of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is very imperative while
   moving sensitive products from one entity to the next entity until it
   reaches to the end-users to avoid damage(s) in the product. In the
   traditional supply chain management system, several serious problems
   such as tampering of products, delay, and fraud, etc. exist. It also
   lacks proper authentication among the participants, data management as
   well as the integrity of the data. The blockchain mechanism is capable
   of solving the above-mentioned issues due to its important features such
   as decentralization, transparency, trust-less environment, anonymity,
   and immutability. This paper describes how the blockchain mechanism
   combines with the traditional pharmaceutical supply chain system and to
   achieve a better SCM system, we present a blockchain-based scheme for
   information sharing securely in the pharmaceutical supply chain system
   with smart contracts and consensus mechanism. The proposed scheme also
   provides a mechanism to distribute required cryptographic keys to all
   the participants securely using the smart contract technique. Further,
   transaction and block validation protocols have been designed in our
   protocol. The security analysis ensures that our protocol is robust and
   also achieves reasonable performance in terms of computation and
   communication overheads. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background: Blockchain technology is a part of Industry 4.0's new
   Internet of Things applications: decentralized systems, distributed
   ledgers, and immutable and cryptographically secure technology. This
   technology entails a series of transaction lists with identical copies
   shared and retained by different groups or parties. One field where
   blockchain technology has tremendous potential is health care, due to
   the more patient-centric approach to the health care system as well as
   blockchain's ability to connect disparate systems and increase the
   accuracy of electronic health records. Objective: The aim of this study
   was to systematically review studies on the use of blockchain technology
   in health care and to analyze the characteristics of the studies that
   have implemented blockchain technology. Methods: This study used a
   systematic review methodology to find literature related to the
   implementation aspect of blockchain technology in health care. Relevant
   papers were searched for using PubMed, SpringerLink, IEEE Xplore,
   Embase, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. A quality assessment of literature was
   performed on the 22 selected papers by assessing their trustworthiness
   and relevance. Results: After full screening, 22 papers were included. A
   table of evidence was constructed, and the results of the selected
   papers were interpreted. The results of scoring for measuring the
   quality of the publications were obtained and interpreted. Out of 22
   papers, a total of 3 (14\%) high-quality papers, 9 (41\%)
   moderate-quality papers, and 10 (45\%) low-quality papers were
   identified. Conclusions: Blockchain technology was found to be useful in
   real health care environments, including for the management of
   electronic medical records, biomedical research and education, remote
   patient monitoring, pharmaceutical supply chains, health insurance
   claims, health data analytics, and other potential areas. The main
   reasons for the implementation of blockchain technology in the health
   care sector were identified as data integrity, access control, data
   logging, data versioning, and nonrepudiation. The findings could help
   the scientific community to understand the implementation aspect of
   blockchain technology. The results from this study help in recognizing
   the accessibility and use of blockchain technology in the health care
   sector.},

Abstract = {The rapid increase in health care data breaches with the existing
   centralized systems emphasizes a decentralized health care system while
   ensuring reliability, privacy, security, and trust. Further, to ensure
   trust in the medical community, scientist, and pharmaceutical, it is
   essential to improve the quality of health care data management. In this
   direction, we proposed a blockchain-based decentralized
   privacy-preserving EMR management (DPEM), which can ensure
   accountability and integrity. We propose a four-layered framework for
   DPEM consisting of a data preparation layer, access control and security
   layer, data sharing layer, and data storage layer with the objectives:
   (i) To provide privacy-preserving in DPEM, we propose a new elliptic
   curve-based content extraction signature (EC-CES) through which patients
   can exclude EMR's sensitive information to eradicate leakage of privacy
   information in the data sharing process. (ii) To provide secure data
   sharing, blockchain smart contracts are used to define the predefined
   access permissions of the patients. (iii) To provide secure storage, we
   use a cloud facility to store actual EMRs, and consortium blockchain is
   used to store respective indexes of EMRs so that the data leakages of
   EMRs could be optimized and simultaneously, indexes in consortium
   blockchain will take care the integrity of EMRs. (iv) To provide access
   control in data sharing, we adopted ciphertext-policy attribute-based
   encryption (CP-ABE) access control policy to empower the owners of data
   to secure the cloud storage and give access to authorized users through
   the encrypted link to the cloud storage with access control policies
   blinded. Finally, the security analysis demonstrates that DPEM is an
   optimized way of achieving EMRs secure data sharing.},

Abstract = {In increasingly diverse areas of activity, the notion of block
   technology appears more and more often. What benefits and how they can
   be applied in the health sector will be presented in this article. This
   system is decentralized and cannot be controlled, and records cannot be
   modified Blockchain technology offers efficiency and low health costs.
   In this way, the health of the population is monitored worldwide, by
   using an encryption program for the storage of patients' databases in
   diagnosis, laboratory analysis, medical imaging, medicine etc. Users are
   encouraged to use such a platform in a peer-to- peer market to have
   permanent access to medical history, and last but not least, to support
   the medical act for a correct diagnosis, research system and
   pharmaceutical industry. The objective of this paper is to achieving a
   technology that will make the medical system more efficient by
   decentralization, faster access to information and the creation of a
   solid database that will bring essential predictability to the system.},

Title = {Securing Drug Distribution Systems from Tampering Using Blockchain},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to overcome coordination flaws and enhance
   end-to-end security in the drug distribution market (DDM). One of the
   major issues in drug market coordination management is the absence of a
   centralized monitoring system to provide adequate market control and
   offer real-time prices, availability, and authentication data. Further,
   tampering is another serious issue affecting the DDM, and as a
   consequence, there is a significant global market for counterfeit drugs.
   This vast counterfeit drug business presents a security risk to the
   distribution system. This study presents a blockchain-based solution to
   challenges such as coordination failure, secure drug delivery, and
   pharmaceutical authenticity. To optimize the drug distribution process
   (DDP), a framework for drug distribution is presented. The proposed
   framework is evaluated using mathematical modeling and a real-life case
   study. According to our results, the proposed technique helps to
   maintain market equilibrium by guaranteeing that there is adequate
   demand while maintaining supply. Using the suggested framework, massive
   data created by the medication supply chain would be appropriately
   handled, allowing market forces to be better regulated and no
   manufactured shortages to inflate medicine prices. The proposed
   framework calls for the Drug Regulatory Authority (DRA) to authenticate
   users on blockchain and to monitor end-to-end DDP. Using the proposed
   framework, big data generated through drug supply chain will be properly
   managed; thus, market forces will be better controlled, and no
   artificial shortages will be generated to raise drug costs.},

Abstract = {Blockchain is commonly considered a potential disruptive technology.
   Moreover, the healthcare industry has experienced rapid growth in the
   adoption of health information technology, such as electronic health
   records and electronic medical records. To guarantee data privacy and
   data security as well as to harness the value of health data, the
   concept of Health Data Bank (HDB) is proposed. In this study, HDB is
   defined as an integrated health data service institution, which bears no
   ``ownership{''} of health data and operates health data under the
   principal-agent model. This study first comprehensively reviews the main
   characters of blockchain and identifies the block-chain-based healthcare
   industry projects and startups in the areas of health insurance,
   pharmacy, and medical treatment. Then, we analyze the fundamental
   principles of HDB and point out four challenges faced by HDB's
   sustainable development: (1) privacy protection and interoperability of
   health data; (2) data rights; (3) health data supervision; (4) and
   willingness to share health data. We also analyze the important benefits
   of blockchain adoption in HDB. Furthermore, three application scenarios
   including distributed storage of health data, smart-contract-based
   healthcare service mode, and consensus-algorithm-based incentive policy
   are proposed to shed light on HDB-based healthcare service mode. In the
   end, this study offers insights into potential research directions and
   challenges.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has grown more pervasive in recent years.
   It makes it possible to describe the physical world in detail and
   interact with it in several different ways. Consequently, IoT has the
   potential to be involved in many different applications, including
   healthcare, supply chain, logistics, and the automotive sector.
   IoT-based smart healthcare systems have significantly increased the
   value of organizations that rely heavily on IoT infrastructures and
   solutions. In fact, with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, IoT played an
   important role in combating diseases. However, IoT devices are tiny,
   with limited capabilities. Therefore, IoT systems lack encryption,
   insufficient privacy protection, and subject to many attacks.
   Accordingly, IoT healthcare systems are extremely vulnerable to several
   security flaws that might result in more accurate, quick, and precise
   diagnoses. On the other hand, blockchain technology has been proven to
   be effective in many critical applications. Blockchain technology
   combined with IoT can greatly improve the healthcare industry's
   efficiency, security, and transparency while opening new commercial
   choices. This paper is an extension of the current effort in the IoT
   smart healthcare systems. It has three main contributions, as follows:
   (1) it proposes a smart unsupervised medical clinic without medical
   staff interventions. It tries to provide safe and fast services
   confronting the pandemic without exposing medical staff to danger. (2)
   It proposes a deep learning algorithm for COVID-19 detection-based X-ray
   images; it utilizes the transfer learning (ResNet152) model. (3) The
   paper also presents a novel blockchain-based pharmaceutical system. The
   proposed algorithms and systems have proven to be effective and secure
   enough to be used in the healthcare environment.},

Abstract = {The future health-care system will contain an ever expanding number of
   digital elements. The data stored both at a centralized health-care
   level and at a local, patient level (e.g., on a smartphone) will be core
   elements when deciding treatment strategies in a health-care scenario
   with Internet of things-based elements. The current way of manufacturing
   pharmaceutical products and related existing logistic-solutions is not
   ready for such a revolution. One of the key challenges is cybersecurity
   and related robust public key infrastructure solution. This work
   introduces one element of a potential solution at a prototype level: the
   concept of cryptopharmaceuticals where pharmaceutical products are
   connected in a patient-specific blockchain of individual dosage units.
   This technology is based on the concept where each produced dosage unit
   has a unique information-rich pattern. A proof-of-concept smartphone
   application was applied to demonstrate the visualization of this
   blockchain at different levels. This includes the manufacturing of the
   individualized dosage unit, the patient view for his/her personal
   blockchain, and integration of these products into a health Internet of
   things system. This unbreakable blockchain of personal medication
   history will provide means to avoid counterfeit products and to enable
   innovative logistic solutions. (c) 2019 American Pharmacists Association

Abstract = {In the current era, blockchain based system getting a lot of attention
   across different industries especially in the domain of supply chain
   because of its streamlined nature at the same time keep the privacy
   intact as well as more efficient than the conventional system. However
   the traditional supply chain faced lot of challenges these days because
   of the complex networks. Blockchain integrated with IoT framework has
   the potential to overcome the challenges faced by the conventional
   systems across industries. Basically the IoT integrated blockchain
   system provides enough benefits such as connecting the link between the
   flows in the supply chain to improve the efficiency of the supply chain
   network, makes the system transparent that can reduce the code of
   conduct violation throughout the supply chain networks, the immutable
   properties helps the stakeholders to trace the products throughout the
   networks. Even though blockchain based system provides enough benefits
   across industries, so far the implementation rate is very low because of
   the lack of knowledge about the benefits of blockchain system as well as
   lack of understanding about how and why it is needed in their fields. In
   this paper we will highlight the difference between the conventional
   supply chain as well as blockchain based supply chain and the benefits
   of implementing blockchain in different sectors such as automotive,
   pharmaceutical, food industry, retail. This article will highlights the
   problems currently facing by the above mentioned industries by using the
   conventional supply chain as well as the solutions to the problems
   provide the blockchain based systems in those industries. This articles
   helps the people across sectors to understand the benefits of the
   blockchain based system in their respect fields as well as implement it
   to improve the efficiency of the overall system.},

Title = {Blockchain concept to combat drug counterfeiting by increasing supply
   chain visibility},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS},
Abstract = {This paper explores problems of pharmaceutical supply chains, such as
   drug counterfeiting, and the opportunities of using digital technologies
   to overcome them. It also evaluates the risks associated with the use of
   digital technologies. Expert interviews were conducted with
   pharmaceutical supply chain stakeholders in the first step. The data
   obtained was assessed through qualitative content analysis. In addition
   to the lack of transparency, strong individual interests of the supply
   chain actors and different implementation levels of digitisation were
   revealed. It is also noticeable that the industry is still
   paper-oriented. Nevertheless, the chosen experts are optimistic about
   the increased use of digital technologies. Combining blockchain with
   other technologies, such as IoT and AI, can improve efficiency,
   traceability, and trust in pharmaceutical supply chains. A digitalised
   supply chain concept is developed based on these technologies, enhancing
   transparency and information availability in the supply chain. In
   addition, communication and processes along the entire pharmaceutical
   supply chain are optimised.},

Abstract = {Technology has always emerged to embolden the existing working process.
   On the one hand, it encourages transparency, accessibility and
   robustness in the system and on the other hand, it begets mitigation of
   the risks and allows us to detect, evaluate and eliminate
   vulnerabilityin the system.The most prominent technologies in todays'
   world like Artificial Intelligence, Virtual/Augmented Reality,
   Automation, Cloud Computing are thriving to solve society's problems and
   ensure the expedition in the process from its previous generation.
   Blockchain technology is no exception in providing the solution to
   eliminate the counterfeit markets across the globe and building trust
   among parties to do business without the fear of indulging or facing any
   unscrupulous business.
   Blockchain technology can ensure data privacy while improving supply
   chain transparency and reducing fraud. It can provide all stakeholders
   within a certain supply chain with access to the same information,
   potentially reducing errors. A decentralised application can pave the
   way to promulgate online pharmaceutical business where health
   information and each stakeholders' data is not compromised. Against this
   backdrop the research conducted throws light on the challenges in the
   online medical drug and devices' distribution and proposes a solution,
   an architectural design for blockchain technology in an online
   pharmaceutical platform to mitigate the counterfeit market while
   bringing efficiency to the ecosystem.},

Abstract = {From the current national-level medical diagnosis and treatment
   perspective, the paper-version prescription is still the only slip
   issued by the doctor to allow for the patient to take the prescribed
   medicine from the pharmacy store or clinic. However, the paper
   prescription is not easy to store and its confidentiality is low, if it
   is lost, it will cause unnecessary trouble to the patient. Therefore,
   the use of digital prescriptions has been considered for future
   electronic medical record reform. The challenges of digital
   prescriptions are also upfront, for instance, it contains a large amount
   of patient's medical record information and private information, how to
   effectively maintain the level of security while the premise of privacy
   has caused a series of hot issues, which become a major concerns of
   people who promote the use of digital prescriptions. In recent years,
   blockchain has been widely regarded as a promising online business data
   and transaction security technology. Due to its decentralization,
   security and credibility, collective maintenance, and non-tampering, it
   is widely used in data storage and sharing. This paper proposes a
   blockchain-based medical prescription system. At the same time, in order
   to effectively protect the privacy of patients, during this period we
   adapted the k-anonymity algorithm and incorporated a differential
   privacy protection mechanism to enhance its secured performance.},

Title = {Design and Implementation of CryptoCargo: A Blockchain-Powered Smart
   Shipping Container for Vaccine Distribution},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {53786-53803},
Abstract = {A large number of shipments are moved everyday domestically and
   internationally. A considerable number of items such as food,
   commodities, and pharmaceutical drugs are prone to damage in transit.
   This can be caused due to various reasons such as improper storage
   conditions and exposure to air or sunlight. The Internet of Things (IoT)
   has been used to enhance fundamental shipment tracking by improving
   transparency and visibility to such transport systems. This paper
   introduces a blockchain-powered smart container system (CryptoCargo)
   that monitors the conditions of the shipment and detects any violations
   that may damage its contents. These violations are recorded on the
   blockchain via smart contracts, which provides a secure and immutable
   storage thereby improving its trustworthiness in an inherently trustless
   environment comprising of multiple stakeholders. We present the design
   and implementation of CryptoCargo including architectural concerns and
   implementation details using a test Ethereum blockchain platform and
   cloud services. Moreover, we present details of thorough evaluation of
   the system to validate its function as well as to assess its
   effectiveness with respect to performance efficiency and real-time
   operation. We have made our smart contract code publicly available on
   Github.},

Abstract = {Distributed ledger technology has seen its debut into communities of
   practice in healthcare where the reliance on knowledge sharing between
   participants postulates the foundations of secure and distributed
   knowledge, especially in some sensitive context, such as patient
   information. This knowledge is essential for the practice of care from
   patient contact to research, pharmaceutical supply chain, medication
   adherence and management of the plethora of bedside data into a
   collection of knowledge about the patient, essential to quality care. We
   introduce different schools of thought and implementation contexts of
   the distributed ledger technology or Blockchain. We provide an overview
   of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology, focused on the
   Healthcare industry, as an initial assessment of the validity of an
   application of Distributed Ledger Technology in a specific knowledge
   management model to solve problems related to knowledge sharing in
   medical knowledge management systems. The paper summarizes some
   instances of most likely and unlikely uses of Blockchain in the
   healthcare setting. The paper also introduces a few use cases where some
   short-term benefits from such implementation.},

Title = {Blockchain-based privacy and security preserving in electronic health: a
   systematic review},
Journal = {MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS},
Abstract = {In today's world, health and medicine play an undeniable role in human
   life. Traditional and current Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems
   that are used to exchange information between medical stakeholders
   (patients, physicians, insurance companies, pharmaceuticals, medical
   researchers, etc.) suffer weaknesses in terms of security and privacy
   due to having centralized architecture. Blockchain technology ensures
   the privacy and security of EHR systems thanks to the use of encryption.
   Moreover, due to its decentralized nature, this technology prevents
   central failure and central attack points. In this paper, a systematic
   literature review (SLR) is proposed to analyze the existing
   Blockchain-based approaches for improving privacy and security in
   electronic health systems. The research methodology, paper selection
   process, and the search query are explained. 51 papers returned from our
   search criteria published between 2018 and Dec 2022 are reviewed. The
   main ideas, type of Blockchain, evaluation metrics, and used tools of
   each selected paper are discussed in detail. Finally, future research
   directions, open challenges, and some issues are discussed.},

Abstract = {With the development of big data and medical information control system,
   electronic medical records sharing across organizations for better
   medical treatment and advancement has attracted much attention both from
   academic and industrial areas. However, the source of big data, personal
   privacy concern, inherent trust issues across organizations and
   complicated regulation hinder the great progress of healthcare
   intelligence. Blockchain, as a novel technique, has been used widely to
   resolve the privacy and security issues in electronic medical records
   sharing process. In this paper, we propose a hybrid blockchain-based
   electronic medical records sharing scheme to address the privacy and
   trust issues across the medical information control systems, rendering
   the electronic medical records sharing process secure, effective,
   relatively transparent, immutable, traceable and auditable. Considering
   the above confidential issues, we use different sharing methods for
   different parts of medical big data. We share privacy-sensitive couples
   on the consortium blockchain, while sharing the non-sensitive parts on
   the public blockchain. In this way, authorized medical information
   control systems within the consortium can access the data on it for
   precise medical diagnosis. Institutions such as universities and
   research institutes can get access to the non-sensitive parts of medical
   big data for scientific research on symptoms to evolve medical
   technologies. A working prototype is implemented to demonstrate how the
   hybrid blockchain facilitates the pharmaceutical operations in a
   healthcare information control ecosystem. A blockchain benchmark tool
   Hyperledger Caliper is used to evaluate the performance of hybrid
   blockchain-based electronic medical records sharing scheme on throughput
   and average latency which proves to be practicable and excellent.},

Abstract = {The blockchain technology can be used in many ways in the pharmaceutical
   industry (e.g.,fraud management, identity management, document
   verification). Blockchain can provide more insight and trustworthiness
   to supply chain processes in the pharmaceutical industry, where
   transport and storage conditions of medications are crucial. This
   article is based on a case study, a qualitative research method,
   investigating how the blockchain technology could be incorporated into
   supply chain management in the pharmaceutical environment. As blockchain
   stores and validates the entire data history, it provides the
   possibility to verify the authenticity of medications, check their
   handling, and monitor physical storage and transport conditions (such
   as, temperature and humidity) to prevent any unintentionally changes of
   their properties. The article proposes a design of an extended supply
   chain management process using blockchain. The main added value of using
   blockchain is having information about storage conditions during the
   entire lfecycle and better protection of the system against fake drugs.},

Abstract = {In recent years, traceability has gained interest since some health
   issues like the mad cow scandal. Able to ensure a follow-up of products
   through each stage of their life-cycle, traceability provides consumers
   more visibility and guarantees on the items they buy. However,
   accessible information about items origins or content does not meet
   consumers, associations and regulatory services growing expectations.
   Furthermore, other concerns like counterfeiting as well as bad headline
   pressures in case of a product recall, urge firms to develop their
   traceability systems which currently show fragilities. Indeed, today,
   companies manage traceability in their way which creates silos.
   Consequently, information flow is slowed and limited along the chain.
   Based on these, the study discusses the concept of aggregating different
   companies traceability management systems into a single one covering all
   the supply chain. The concept implementation is made possible through
   collaborative platforms like the Blockchain. In terms of traceability,
   this technology presents interests in recording transactions in a
   transparent, reliable and secure ways. However, it first requires data
   to be structured before makes it concrete. The contribution of this
   paper is to provide a meta model as a first groundwork for a possible
   Blockchain implementation for supply chain traceability purposes. Its
   objective is to i) identify and monitor key traceability information
   regarded as master, event or transactional data ii) highlight the
   connections with actors and the sequence of events generated along the
   product journey. The meta model's behaviour is then, illustrated through
   a case study from the pharmaceutical industry.},

Abstract = {We seek to guide operations management (OM) research on the
   implementation of supply chain traceability systems by identifying
   business requirements and the factors critical to successful
   implementation. We first motivate the need for implementing traceability
   systems in two very different industries-cobalt mining and
   pharmaceuticals-and present business requirements and critical success
   factors for implementation. Next, we describe how we carried out
   thematic analysis of practitioner and scholarly articles on implementing
   blockchain for supply chain traceability. Finally, we present our
   results pertaining to the needs of different stakeholders such as
   suppliers, consumers, and regulators. The business requirements for
   traceability systems are curbing illegal practices; improving
   sustainability performance; increasing operational efficiency; enhancing
   supply-chain coordination; and sensing market trends. Critical success
   factors for implementation are companies' capabilities; collaboration;
   technology maturity; supply chain practices; leadership; and governance
   of the traceability efforts. These findings provide a nascent
   measurement model for empirical work and a foundation for descriptive
   and normative research on blockchain applications for supply chain
   traceability.},

Abstract = {An ever growing variety of smart, connected Internet of Things (IoT)
   devices poses completely new challenges for businesses regarding
   security and privacy. In fact, the adoption of smart products may depend
   on the ability of organizations to offer systems that ensure adequate
   sensor data integrity while guaranteeing sufficient user privacy. In
   light of these challenges, previous research indicates that blockchain
   technology could be a promising means to mitigate issues of data
   security arising in the IoT. Building upon the existing body of
   knowledge, we propose a design theory, including requirements, design
   principles, and features, for a blockchain-based sensor data protection
   system (SDPS) that leverages data certification. To support this, we
   designed and developed an instantiation of an SDPS (CertifiCar) in three
   iterative cycles intented to prevent the fraudulent manipulation of car
   mileage data. Following the explication of our SDPS, we provide an ex
   post evaluation of our design theory considering CertifiCar and two
   additional use cases in the areas of pharmaceutical supply chains and
   energy microgrids. Our results suggest that the proposed design ensures
   the tamper-resistant gathering, processing, and exchange of IoT sensor
   data in a privacy-preserving, scalable, and efficient manner.},

Abstract = {With the development of electronic information technology, electronic
   medical records (EMRs) have been a common way to store the patients'
   data in hospitals. They are stored in different hospitals' databases,
   even for the same patient. Therefore, it is difficult to construct a
   summarized EMR for one patient from multiple hospital databases due to
   the security and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, current EMRs systems lack
   a standard data management and sharing policy, making it difficult for
   pharmaceutical scientists to develop precise medicines based on data
   obtained under different policies. To solve the above problems, we
   proposed a blockchain-based information management system, MedBlock, to
   handle patients' information. In this scheme, the distributed ledger of
   MedBlock allows the efficient EMRs access and EMRs retrieval. The
   improved consensus mechanism achieves consensus of EMRs without large
   energy consumption and network congestion. In addition, MedBlock also
   exhibits high information security combining the customized access
   control protocols and symmetric cryptography. MedBlock can play an
   important role in the sensitive medical information sharing.},

Abstract = {In order to solve the problem of value appreciation and evaluation of
   pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprises, we propose an automatic
   decision-making value system model. Firstly, by applying blockchain and
   smart contracts, we design general model and basic technology
   architecture of automatic decision-making value system. Then, by
   analyzing the characteristics of the value chain of the pharmaceutical
   manufacturing industry, we further construct an automatic
   decision-making value system model applied in the pharmaceutical
   manufacturing industry, and propose an index system for enterprise value
   evaluation based on four dimensions of integration, optimization,
   control and valueadded satisfaction. Finally, the case explains the
   application of the value system that can be used in conjunction with the
   alliance chain, the private chain, the public chain, and the process of
   enterprise value assessment. The automatic decision value system model
   can help optimize the enterprise value chain and assess the true value
   of the enterprise from four aspects: integration, optimization, control,
   and value-added satisfaction.},

Title = {A Blockchain and Machine Learning-Based Drug Supply Chain Management and
   Recommendation System for Smart Pharmaceutical Industry},

Abstract = {From the last decade, pharmaceutical companies are facing difficulties
   in tracking their products during the supply chain process, allowing the
   counterfeiters to add their fake medicines into the market. Counterfeit
   drugs are analyzed as a very big challenge for the pharmaceutical
   industry worldwide. As indicated by the statistics, yearly business loss
   of around \$200 billion is reported by US pharmaceutical companies due
   to these counterfeit drugs. These drugs may not help the patients to
   recover the disease but have many other dangerous side effects.
   According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey report, in
   under-developed countries every 10th drug use by the consumers is
   counterfeit and has low quality. Hence, a system that can trace and
   track drug delivery at every phase is needed to solve the counterfeiting
   problem. The blockchain has the full potential to handle and track the
   supply chain process very efficiently. In this paper, we have proposed
   and implemented a novel blockchain and machine learning-based drug
   supply chain management and recommendation system (DSCMR). Our proposed
   system consists of two main modules: blockchain-based drug supply chain
   management and machine learning-based drug recommendation system for
   consumers. In the first module, the drug supply chain management system
   is deployed using Hyperledger fabrics which is capable of continuously
   monitor and track the drug delivery process in the smart pharmaceutical
   industry. On the other hand, the N-gram, LightGBM models are used in the
   machine learning module to recommend the top-rated or best medicines to
   the customers of the pharmaceutical industry. These models have trained
   on well known publicly available drug reviews dataset provided by the
   UCI: an open-source machine learning repository. Moreover, the machine
   learning module is integrated with this blockchain system with the help
   of the REST API. Finally, we also perform several tests to check the
   efficiency and usability of our proposed system.},

Abstract = {Counterfeit drugs are without a doubt becoming a greater hazard to
   consumers and the pharmaceutical sector. As a result, real-time
   visibility of drug manufacturing and management is required. The
   proposed system uses Ethereum blockchain as the main technology. The
   primary advantage of blockchain technology is that the transactions are
   maintained in immutable digital ledger format and it may be read easily
   without jeopardizing the users security and privacy. In our proposed
   system, the admin validates and adds the manufacturers. The manufacturer
   after registering and logging in can perform tasks like adding the drug
   and seller list. The seller can place order to the manufacturer which
   the manufacturer can accept or reject. The seller can update status of
   order of accepted orders to delivered. The customer can view the order
   details by entering the serial number on the drug package. Any
   transaction or exchange that occurs in the network is recorded in the
   chain. It functions similarly to other networks, but blockchain
   technology is distinguished by the fact that no data can be removed or
   altered by anyone in the network. No changes to the network can be made
   unless it has been validated by all of the networks authorized users.
   All the information stored can be read by anybody so to incorporate more
   security, AES has been used to store data in the blockchain. The use of
   AES encryption technique distinguishes this system from all the existing
   implementations. Thus, this makes it easy to trace to the exact point in
   the supply chain and detect any counterfeit drugs in movement. As an
   extension to the drug counterfeit prevention system a Drug
   Recommendation System is also performed using the ensemble model with a
   combination of Random Forest and Logistic Regression for sentiment
   analysis training. Furthermore, when compared to the existing Linear SVM
   model, which has an accuracy of 90.39\%, the suggested model has the
   best accuracy of 93.31\%. Using the obtained sentiment for each drug,
   the drug is predicted accurately for the specified medical condition.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Abstract = {This research shows a Viable Supply Chain with Vendor Managed Inventory
   approach by considering Blockchain, Risk, and Robustness. We embedded
   Blockchain Technology (BCT) to improve SC agility. To tackle risk and
   robustness, we suggest a new objective function with the weighted
   expected value, worst case, and Entropic Value at Risk for considering
   risk and robustness under different scenarios. This model is
   Mixed-Integer Linear Programming, and GAMS-Bonmin is utilized to solve
   it. The case study of this research is on the Pharmacy industry. We
   compare problems in the situation with BCT and without BCT. The results
   show that the cost function of the main problem without BCT is greater
   than the same problem with BCT, and its gaps are 0.61\%. Finally, the
   cost function increase by increasing the conservative coefficient and
   decreasing the resiliency coefficient. The cost function reduces by
   increasing the confidence level. We change the scale of the problem and
   define problems. By increasing the scale of the problem, the solution
   time increased.},

Title = {Blockchain-based medical health record access control scheme with
   efficient protection mechanism and patient control},
Journal = {MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS},
Abstract = {The patient's medical health record (PMHR) has always provided a large
   amount of research data to medical institutions and pharmaceutical
   companies, etc., and has contributed to the development in medical
   research. However, such PMHR data contains the patient's personal
   privacy and should be shared under the control of the patients, not the
   hospital where this data is acquired. In order to protect the privacy of
   PMHR data while realizing efficient data sharing, this paper proposes a
   blockchain-based sharing and protection scheme. In this solution, the
   PMHR data are encrypted and stored in a cloud server, which is equipped
   with an access control scheme implemented as a smart contract on a
   blockchain. Different from previous works, in order to ensure efficient
   access and reduce the workload of patients, the types of users who can
   apply for access are limited to hospitals and pharmaceutical companies.
   In order to resist the potential Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, we
   have introduced an improved proxy re-encryption scheme to ensure the
   secrecy of PMHR data while reducing the computational complexity. The
   whole system is implemented using Solidity and tested on 10 nodes for
   function verification. Experimental result shows that the proposed
   system is more efficient than previous systems. Security under the MITM
   attack is also ensured by security analysis.},

Abstract = {Pharmaceutical cold chain is a special branch of the logistics industry,
   which has strict requirements for warehousing and transportation in the
   supply chain. In order to improve the credibility of pharmaceutical
   products and ensure the life safety of the people, it is necessary to
   realize the credible traceability of the entire life cycle of
   pharmaceutical products. The cost of pharmaceutical cold chain is high.
   Warehousing and transportation cost per unit of cold chain products is
   much higher than those of ordinary supply chain products. Intelligent
   prediction of cold chain product demand is an important way to reduce
   warehousing and transportation cost and improve market competitiveness
   of cold chain enterprises. Firstly, this paper proposes a pharmaceutical
   cold chain supervision scheme based on blockchain, cloud storage and
   Internet of things to realize the trusted traceability of the whole life
   cycle of pharmaceutical products and ensure the product safety. Then,
   based on the high-quality and large-scale data generated in the proposed
   cold chain supervision system, a cold chain product demand forecasting
   scheme based on deep learning is constructed to assist the cold chain
   inventory management decision-making, so as to reduce the warehousing
   cost of cold chain products.},

Abstract = {Drug counterfeit has become a global issue. The counterfeit problem has
   become so huge that it has drawn a significant attention among
   researchers and policy makers. The fake drug industry is worth of 10
   billion dollar per year as estimated by `ASSOCHAM' in 2017. Also
   estimated by WHO about a million die per year due to fake drugs. The
   dispensation of fake drugs is the pivotal concern, specially in
   developing countries like India. One of main reason in drug
   counterfeiting is imperfect supply chain. There are many loop holes in
   our current policy of drug supply chain management system. In the
   present scenario of supply chain, either the information is not shared
   between the parties during the hand off process at all or a little or
   irrelevant information is shared. Once a party transfer the drug to
   another party, the first party doesn't know what happens to the drugs
   there after. The counterfeit drug not only affect the health condition
   of patient or the financial loss of genuine manufacturer but also it is
   posing serious threat to the socio-economic status of the society. In
   this paper, we explain details of the drug counterfeit along with a
   little history of the pharmacy industry and its impact on different
   areas and also to counter the counterfeits using Blockchain technology.
   Using Blockchain technology we explained here how to add traceability,
   visibility, and security to the drug supply chain. This proposed system
   will track the drugs from its origin from the manufacturer to the end
   the consumer.},

Title = {Blockchain technology and vaccine supply chain: Exploration and analysis
   of the adoption barriers in the Indian context},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {255},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The vaccine distribution system, being a bio-pharmaceutical cold chain,
   is a complicated and sensitive system that must be effectively managed
   and maintained due to its direct impact on public health. However,
   vaccine supply chains continue to be affected by concerns, including
   vaccine expiry, inclusion of counterfeit vaccines, and vaccine record
   fraud. The blockchain technology integrated with the Internet of Things
   (IoT) can create a solution for global vaccine distributions with
   improved trust, transparency, traceability, and data management, which
   will help monitor the cold chain, tackle counterfeit drugs,
   surveillance, and waste management. Several theoretical models for
   vaccine management with blockchain have recently been published, and a
   few pilot studies for COVID-19 vaccine management using blockchain have
   been started in India. Still, full-scale adoption of blockchain
   technology in vaccine distribution and management has yet to be achieved
   due to underlying barriers. This study explores the adoption barriers
   utilizing Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework with the
   help of extant literature and inputs from administrators, academics,
   immunization, and blockchain experts and then analyzed using the Delphi
   and fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Labo-ratory (DEMATEL)
   techniques. The finding shows that the requirement of change in
   organizational structure and policies is the most prominent barrier, and
   the barrier related to requirement of large-scale IoT infrastructure and
   lack of technical expertise are the most impactful barriers. The
   theoretical contribution of this study lies in the identification and
   analysis of barriers that should be addressed to achieve blockchain
   technology adoption in the vaccine supply chain.},

Title = {A Systematic Review of Blockchain in Healthcare: Frameworks, Prototypes,

Abstract = {Blockchain, a form of distributed ledger technology has attracted the
   interests of stakeholders across several sectors including healthcare.
   Its' potential in the multi-stakeholder operated sector like health has
   been responsible for several investments, studies, and implementations.
   Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems traditionally used for the
   exchange of health information amongst healthcare stakeholders have been
   criticised for centralising power, failures and attack-points with
   exchange data custodians. EHRs have struggled in the face of
   multi-stakeholder and system requirements while adhering to security,
   privacy, ethical and other regulatory constraints. Blockchain is
   promising amongst others to address the many EHR challenges, primarily
   trustless and secure exchange of health information amongst
   stakeholders. Many blockchain-in-healthcare frameworks have been
   proposed; some prototyped and/or implemented. This study leveraged the
   PRISMA framework to systematically search and evaluate the different
   models proposed; prototyped and/or implemented. The bibliometric and
   functional distribution of all 143 articles from this study were
   presented. This study evaluated 61 articles that discussed either
   prototypes or pilot or implementations. The technical and architectural
   analysis of these 61 articles for privacy, security, cost, and
   performance were detailed. Blockchain was found to solve the trust,
   security and privacy constraints of traditional EHRs often at
   significant performance, storage and cost trade-offs.},

Abstract = {Drug traceability system is essentially important for public drug
   security and business of pharmaceutical companies, which aims to track
   or trace where the drug has been and where it has gone along the drug
   supply chain. Traditional centralized server-client technical solutions
   have been far from satisfying for their bad performances in data
   authenticity, privacy, system resilience and flexibility.
   In this paper, we propose a scenario-oriented blockchain system for drug
   traceability and regulation called Drugledger, which reconstructs the
   whole service architecture by separating service provider into three
   independent service components and ensures the authenticity and privacy
   of traceability data. Drugledger is more resilient than traditional
   solutions with its p2p architecture. Furthermore, Drugledger could
   efficiently prune its storage, achieving a finally stable and acceptable
   blockchain storage. Besides, algorithms reflecting the real drug supply
   chain logic (e.g. package, repackage, unpackage, etc.) are designed
   based on the expanded UTXO workflow in Drugledger. To our knowledge, it
   is the first systematic work from both a technical and practical
   perspective on how blockchain system could be designed for drug
   traceability and regulation.},

Abstract = {Healthcare supply chains are complex structures spanning across multiple
   organizational and geographical boundaries, providing critical backbone
   to services vital for everyday life. The inherent complexity of such
   systems can introduce impurities including inaccurate information, lack
   of transparency and limited data provenance. Counterfeit drugs is one
   consequence of such limitations within existing supply chains which not
   only has serious adverse impact on human health but also causes severe
   economic loss to the healthcare industry. Consequently, existing studies
   have emphasized the need for a robust, end-to-end track and trace system
   for pharmaceutical supply chains. Therein, an end-to-end product
   tracking system across the pharmaceutical supply chain is paramount to
   ensuring product safety and eliminating counterfeits. Most existing
   track and trace systems are centralized leading to data privacy,
   transparency and authenticity issues in healthcare supply chains. In
   this article, we present an Ethereum blockchain-based approach
   leveraging smart contracts and decentralized off-chain storage for
   efficient product traceability in the healthcare supply chain. The smart
   contract guarantees data provenance, eliminates the need for
   intermediaries and provides a secure, immutable history of transactions
   to all stakeholders. We present the system architecture and detailed
   algorithms that govern the working principles of our proposed solution.
   We perform testing and validation, and present cost and security
   analysis of the system to evaluate its effectiveness to enhance
   traceability within pharmaceutical supply chains.},

Abstract = {The cost and complexity of conducting multi-site clinical trials have
   significantly increased over time, with site monitoring, data
   management, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) amendments being key
   drivers. Trial sponsors, such as pharmaceutical companies, are also
   increasingly outsourcing trial management to multiple organizations.
   Enforcing compliance with standard operating procedures, such as
   preserving data privacy for human subject protection, is crucial for
   upholding the integrity of a study and its findings. Current efforts to
   ensure quality of data collected at multiple sites and by multiple
   organizations lack a secure, trusted, and efficient framework for
   fragmented data capture. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
   data management infrastructure based on a permissioned blockchain with
   private channels, smart contracts, and distributed ledgers. We use an
   example multi-organizational clinical trial to design and implement a
   blockchain network: generate activity-specific private channels to
   segregate data flow for confidentiality, write channel-specific smart
   contracts to enforce regulatory guidelines, monitor the immutable
   transaction log to detect protocol breach, and auto-generate audit
   trail. Through comprehensive experimental study, we demonstrate that our
   system handles high-throughput transactions, exhibits low-latency, and
   constitutes a trusted, scalable solution.},

Abstract = {Privacy is a fundamental right for every human, but in today's world,
   this is not ensured in every sector. The health sector is such an
   example where patients privacy is not respected, and sensitive data like
   prescription dosages, medical bill amounts, and their entire medical
   history are leaked online without any encryption. We designed,
   implemented and deployed an architecture in this research where we tried
   to use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Hyperledger fabric and
   simulated workflow of healthcare sector while ensuring that patients'
   medical records are in complete control of patient only. Hyperledger
   fabric {[}1], which is a blockchain framework, provides integrity to the
   medical records, which can be verified at any later point of time. Proxy
   re-encryption {[}2] has been used to provide medical records access to
   others but only with permission from the patient. Besides patients and
   hospitals, this architecture also involves other institutions like
   insurance companies and pharmacies to provide various services to the
   patients. Lastly, we performed some performance experiments on the
   architecture to check the throughput and latencies.},

Title = {A Novel Medical Blockchain Model for Drug Supply Chain Integrity
   Management in a Smart Hospital},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {At present, in pharmacology one of the most serious problems is
   counterfeit drugs. The Health Research Funding organization reported
   that in developing countries, nearly 10-30\% of the drugs are fake.
   Counterfeiting is not the main issue itself, but, rather, the fact that,
   as compared to traditional drugs, these counterfeit drugs produce
   different side effects to human health. According to WHO, around 30\% of
   the total medicine sold in Africa, Asia, and Latin America is
   counterfeit. This is the major worldwide problem, and the situation is
   worse in developing countries, where one out of every 10 medicines are
   either fake or do not follow drug regulations. The rise of Internet
   pharmacies has made it more difficult to standardize drug safety. It is
   difficult to detect counterfeits because these drugs pass through
   different complex distributed networks, thus forming opportunities for
   counterfeits to enter the authentic supply chain. The safety of the
   pharmaceutical supply chain has become a major concern for public
   health, which is a collective process. In this paper, we propose a novel
   drug supply chain management using Hyperledger Fabric based on
   blockchain technology to handle secure drug supply chain records. The
   proposed system solves this problem by conducting drug record
   transactions on a blockchain to create a smart healthcare ecosystem with
   a drug supply chain. A smart contract is launched to give time-limited
   access to electronic drug records and also patient electronic health
   records. We also carried out a number of experiments in order to
   demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the designed platform.
   Finally, we used Hyperledger Caliper as a benchmarking tool to conduct
   the performance of the designed system in terms of transactions per
   second, transaction latency, and resource utilization.},

Abstract = {Traceability has become a critical element in supply chain management,
   particularly in safety-sensitive sectors like food, pharmaceuticals,
   etc. Upstream (manufacturers, producers, etc.) and downstream
   (distributors, wholesalers, etc.) supply chain members need to store and
   handle traceability-related information for providing proof of
   regulatory compliance to both state authorities and more demanding
   customers. Consumers also place high expectations on food supply chains
   (FSC) with specific emphasis on facets related to safety. However, the
   complexity of modern FSC networks and their fragmentation act as
   barriers for the development of sound traceability mechanisms. In this
   paper a distributed trustless and secure architecture for FSC
   traceability is developed and tested. For assessing the feasibility of
   the proposed approach, a food traceability case study from a dairy
   company is presented. The applicability of the model is further
   illustrated by the development of fully functional smart contracts and a
   local private blockchain. Moreover, the various links between the
   proposed blockchain-based model and its managerial implications are
   presented. The overall benefits of the proposed model are discussed
   along with fruitful areas for future research. The results are of
   significant value to both practitioners and researchers.},

   pharmaceutical traceability},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {154},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {To solve the problems of high latency, high system overhead, and small
   supported scale in the current application of pharmaceutical
   traceability combined with blockchain technology, an algorithm called
   Pharmaceutical -Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (P-PBFT) based on
   PBFT, grouping, and credit voting is proposed. The al-gorithm combines
   the characteristics of a pharmaceutical supply chain, optimizes the
   consistency protocol in the original algorithm, divides large-scale
   network nodes into different consensus sets by response speed, and
   per-forms grouping consensus. The algorithm's credit model and voting
   mechanism dynamically updates user status according to the behavior of
   nodes in consensus, evaluates the reliability of users, and also serves
   as a basis for electing management nodes. Experimental results show that
   the improved P-PBFT consensus algorithm provides smaller latency and
   higher throughput for pharmaceutical traceability systems, supports
   larger-scale traceability, effectively alleviates the dramatic increase
   in communication among network nodes, and reduces the influence of
   malicious nodes.},

Title = {Blockchain-Based Secure Storage and Access Scheme For Electronic Medical
   Records in IPFS},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {59389-59401},
Abstract = {Electronic medical records can help people prevent diseases, improve
   cure rates, provide a significant basis for medical institutions and
   pharmaceutical companies, and provide legal evidence for medical
   negligence and medical disputes. However, the integrity and security
   problems of electronic medical data still intractable. In this paper,
   based on the ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption system and
   IPFS storage environment, combined with blockchain technology, we
   constructed an attribute-based encryption scheme for secure storage and
   efficient sharing of electronic medical records in IPFS storage
   environment. Our scheme is based on ciphertext policy attribute
   encryption, which effectively controls the access of electronic medical
   data without affecting efficient retrieval. Meanwhile, we store the
   encrypted electronic medical data in the decentralized InterPlanetary
   File System (IPFS), which not only ensures the security of the storage
   platform but also solves the problem of the single point of failure.
   Besides, we leverage the non-tamperable and traceable nature of
   blockchain technology to achieve secure storage and search for medical
   data. The security proof shows that our scheme achieves selective
   security for the choose keyword attacks. Performance analysis and real
   data set simulation experiments shows that our scheme is efficient and
   feasible.},

Title = {A robust drug recall supply chain management system using hyperledger
   blockchain ecosystem},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {140},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Drug recall is a critical issue for manufacturing companies, as a
   manufacturer might face criticism and severe business downfall due to a
   defective drug. A defective drug is a highly detrimental issue, as it
   can cost several lives. Therefore, recalling the drug becomes one of the
   most sensitive issues in the pharmaceutical industry. This paper
   presents a blockchain-enabled network that allows manufacturers to
   effectively monitor a drug while in the supply chain with improved
   security and transparency throughout the process. The study also tries
   to minimize the cost and time sustained by the manufacturing company to
   transfer the drug to the end-user by proposing forward and backward
   supply chain mathematical models. Specifically, the forward chain model
   supports drug delivery from the manufacturer to the end-user in less
   time with a reliable transport mode. The backward supply chain model
   explicitly focuses on reducing the extra time and cost incurred to the
   manufacturer in pursuit of recalling the defective drug. Moreover, a
   real-time implementation of the proposed blockchainenabled supply chain
   management system using the Hyperledger Composer is done to demonstrate
   the transparency of the process.},

Abstract = {Over the past several years, the adoption of HealthCare Monitoring
   Systems (HCS) in health centers and organizations like hospitals or
   eldery homes growth significantly. The adoption of such systems is
   revolutionized by a propelling advancements in IoT and Blockchain
   technologies. Owing to technological advancement in IoT sensors market,
   innovations in HCS to monitor patients health status have motivated many
   countries to strength their efforts to support their citizens with such
   care delivery systems under the directives of a physician who has access
   to patient's data. Nevertheless, secure data sharing is a principal
   patient's concern to be comfort to use such systems. Current HCS are not
   able to provide reassuring security policies. For that, one of our focus
   in this work, is to provide security countermeasures, likewise
   cost-efficient solution for HCS by integrating storage model based on
   Blockchain and Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS). Blockchain technology
   is an emerging solution in pharmaceutical industry and starts to take
   place for HCS and allows HealthCare providers to track connected devices
   and control access to shared data, hence protecting patients' privacy.
   Furthermore, the addition of Edge and Fog computing has improved HCS to
   react in real-time and enhance their reliability. A variety of
   communication protocols can connect sensor devices to edge/Fog layer and
   the best choice will depend upon connectivity requirements: range,
   bandwidth, power, interoperability, security, and reliability. Instead,
   systems efficiency would decline and hurt if communication protocol is
   inconsistent. LoRa (Long Range) communications technology is emerging as
   the leader among Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) entering the IoT
   domain benefiting from many features such as long-range distances and
   low power consumption. This work proposes LoRaChainCare, an architecture
   model for HCS which combines the technologies Blockchain, Fog/Edge
   computing, and the LoRa communication protocol. A real implementation of
   LoRaChainCare system is presented and evaluated in terms of cost, run
   time and power consumption.},

Title = {Blockchain Technology for Detecting Falsified and Substandard Drugs in
   Distribution: Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Intervention},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Drug counterfeiting is a global problem with significant
   risks to consumers and the general public. In the Philippines, 30\% of
   inspected drug stores in 2003 were found with
   substandard/spurious/falsely-labeled/falsified/counterfeit drugs. The
   economic burden on the population drug expenditures and on governments
   is high. The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages
   the public to check the certificates of product registration and report
   any instances of counterfeiting. The National Police of Philippines
   responds to such reports through a special task force. However, no
   literature on its impact on the distribution of such drugs were found.
   Blockchain technology is a cryptographic ledger that is allegedly
   immutable through repeated sequential hashing and fault-tolerant through
   a consensus algorithm. This project will develop and test a
   pharmacosurveillance blockchain system that will support information
   sharing along the official drug distribution network.
   Objective: This study aims to develop a pharmacosurveillance blockchain
   system and test its functions in a simulated network.
   Methods: We are developing a Distributed Application (DApp) that will
   run on smart contracts, employing Swarm as the Distributed File System
   (DFS). Two instances will be developed: one for Ethereum and another for
   Hyperledger Fabric. The proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm of
   Ethereum will be modified into a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) or
   practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm as it is
   scalable and fits the drug supply chain environment. The system will
   adopt the GS1 pedigree standard and will satisfy the data points in the
   data standardization guidelines from the US FDA. Simulations will use
   the following 5 nodes: for FDA, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and
   the consumer portal.
   Results: Development is underway. The design of the system will place
   FDA in a supervisory data verification role, with each pedigree
   type-specific data source serving a primary data verification role. The
   supply chain process will be initiated by the manufacturer, with
   recursive verification for every transaction. It will allow consumers to
   scan a code printed on the receipt of their purchases to review the drug
   distribution history.
   Conclusions: Development and testing will be conducted in a simulated
   network, and thus, results may differ from actual practice. The project
   being proposed is disruptive; once tested, the team intends to engage
   the Philippine FDA to discuss implementation plans and formulate
   policies to facilitate adoption and sustainability.},

Abstract = {Healthcare, one of the most important industries, is data-oriented, but
   most of the research in this industry focuses on incorporating the
   internet of things (IoT) or connecting medical equipment. Very few
   researchers are looking at the data generated in the healthcare
   industry. Data are very important tools in this competitive world, as
   they can be integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) to promote
   sustainability. Healthcare data include the health records of patients,
   drug-related data, clinical trials data, data from various medical
   equipment, etc. Most of the data management processes are manual,
   time-consuming, and error-prone. Even then, different healthcare
   industries do not trust each other to share and collaborate on data.
   Distributed ledger technology is being used for innovations in different
   sectors including healthcare. This technology can be incorporated to
   maintain and exchange data between different healthcare organizations,
   such as hospitals, insurance companies, laboratories, pharmacies, etc.
   Various attributes of this technology, such as its immutability,
   transparency, provenance etc., can bring trust and security to the
   domain of the healthcare sector. In this paper, a decentralized access
   control model is proposed to enable the secure interoperability of
   different healthcare organizations. This model uses the Ethereum
   blockchain for its implementation. This model interfaces patients,
   doctors, chemists, and insurance companies, empowering the consistent
   and secure exchange of data. The major concerns are maintaining a
   history of the transactions and avoiding unauthorized updates in health
   records. Any transaction that changes the state of the data is reflected
   in the distributed ledger and can be easily traced with this model. Only
   authorized entities can access their respective data. Even the
   administrator will not be able to modify any medical records.},

Title = {VigilRx: A Scalable and Interoperable Prescription Management System
   Using Blockchain},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {25973-25986},
Abstract = {Achieving interoperability between healthcare providers is a major
   challenge. Current systems for managing prescription records suffer from
   data siloing, unnecessary record duplication, and slow record transfers.
   In many systems, patients do not retain control over their prescription
   data. Instead, they must use an intermediary to access or transfer their
   records. Furthermore, record transfers suffer from differing standards
   between providers, outdated communication methods, and information
   blocking. Solving these problems necessitates the creation of an
   interoperable prescription management system. Realizing such a system
   requires considering security, efficiency, scalability, and other
   challenges. Recent regulatory actions attempt to address these
   challenges, but fundamental issues persist. This paper proposes a
   patient-centric and interoperable prescription system that ensures
   patient control, prevents information blocking, and improves transfer
   efficiency. We call our solution VigilRx-a system that uses blockchain
   and smart contracts to manage prescriptions. Stakeholders exist as one
   of three role-based smart contracts within the system: patient,
   prescriber, or pharmacy. These role contracts ensure the system is
   patient-centric by assigning ownership of prescription records directly
   to patients. Our smart contracts also ensure the system's
   interoperability, as we use a standardized prescription contract to
   ensure records can be easily managed. VigilRx's use of blockchain also
   promotes transparency by providing patients an explicit list of parties
   that hold permission to access their records. Use of existing software
   patterns allows the system to adapt as needed. We implement VigilRx and
   show that it is both scalable and efficient.},

Abstract = {Objective To evaluate the attitudes of the parties involved in the
   system toward the new features and measure the potential benefits of
   introducing the use of blockchain and machine learning (ML) to
   strengthen the in-place methods for safely prescribing medication. The
   proposed blockchain will strengthen the security and privacy of the
   patient's prescription information shared in the network. Once the
   ePrescription is submitted, it is only available in read-only mode. This
   will ensure there is no alteration to the ePrescription information
   after submission. In addition, the blockchain will provide an improved
   tracking mechanism to ensure the originality of the ePrescription and
   that a prescriber can only submit an ePrescription with the patient's
   authorization. Lastly, before submitting an ePrescription, an ML
   algorithm will be used to detect any anomalies (eg, missing fields,
   misplaced information, or wrong dosage) in the ePrescription to ensure
   the safety of the prescribed medication for the patient. Methods The
   survey contains questions about the features introduced in the proposed
   ePrescription system to evaluate the security, privacy, reliability, and
   availability of the ePrescription information in the system. The study
   population is comprised of 284 respondents in the patient group, 39
   respondents in the pharmacist group, and 27 respondents in the
   prescriber group, all of whom met the inclusion criteria. The response
   rate was 80\% (226/284) in the patient group, 87\% (34/39) in the
   pharmacist group, and 96\% (26/27) in the prescriber group. Key Findings
   The vast majority of the respondents in all groups had a positive
   attitude toward the proposed ePrescription system's security and privacy
   using blockchain technology, with 72\% (163/226) in the patient group,
   70.5\% (24/34) in the pharmacist group, and 73\% (19/26) in the
   prescriber group. Moreover, the majority of the respondents in the
   pharmacist (70\%, 24/34) and prescriber (85\%, 22/26) groups had a
   positive attitude toward using ML algorithms to generate alerts
   regarding prescribed medication to enhance the safety of medication
   prescribing and prevent medication errors. Conclusion Our survey showed
   that a vast majority of respondents in all groups had positive attitudes
   toward using blockchain and ML algorithms to safely prescribe
   medications. However, a need for minor improvements regarding the
   proposed features was identified, and a post-implementation user study
   is needed to evaluate the proposed ePrescription system in depth.},

Abstract = {Genomic data repositories are rapidly growing due to the decline in the
   cost of DNA sequencing. This has increased the demand from stakeholders
   such as researchers to analyze these datasets to advance areas in
   biomedical research. Genomic datasets are mostly maintained by
   third-party directto-consumer (DTC) genomic companies who operate a
   business model of collecting DNA data from their customers and selling
   them to pharmaceutical companies. This puts the privacy of their
   customers at risk since each individual's human genome is unique. In
   addition, customers lose ownership of and access to their genomic data
   to DTCs and DTCs do not share profits from data sales with them. In this
   paper, we propose a system based on blockchain technology and
   homomorphic computation to address the aforementioned problems. We use
   blockchain transactions and smart contracts to allow genomic data owners
   (DOs) to have control of their data and sell access to it, and
   homomorphic computation with secure two-party protocol to enable genomic
   data users (DUs) to run queries to securely discover DOs of interest. We
   further optimize the query response time by proposing an approach based
   on genomic data partitions, binary search trees and bloom filters to
   reduce the search space. We also propose a blockchain penalty mechanism
   to encourage parties to behave honestly to avoid malicious behaviors
   such as uploading fake or non-human genomic data. We conduct our
   experiments on real genomic datasets and demonstrate that our proposed
   scheme allows DOs to control access to their data and is feasible and
   efficient in terms of computation cost, query response time and
   scalability. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Blockchain, cryptographically linked blocks of data, is the key
   technology behind the infamous cryptocurrency Bitcoin, however,
   blockchain can serve more use cases than just cryptocurrency. The
   technology has use cases in any industry that generates and transfers
   data. In a use case such as cryptocurrency the blockchain is used to
   manage transactions from peer-to-peer in a way that does not allow for
   that transaction's data to be manipulated by one of the involved parties
   or a third party. This is a valuable process that other industries could
   leverage. One such industry that could benefit from applying blockchain
   technology for a multitude of cases is the healthcare industry. Primary
   care doctors could be connected to a blockchain system that allowed them
   to access patient data and securely monitor the respective patient,
   pharmaceutical companies could increase their products validity in the
   marketplace with individual product tracking, and the insurance industry
   could trust all the information about a client. All of these are
   possible use cases for blockchain in the healthcare industry. Currently,
   the healthcare industry is not leveraging the blockchain at scale.
   Within this paper we are going to explore the possibilities for
   blockchain technology and the use cases in the healthcare industry
   specifically, and how the different industries within the healthcare
   industry can implement a blockchain system.},

Abstract = {Over the past several years, many healthcare applications have been
   developed to enhance the healthcare industry. Recent advancements in
   information technology and blockchain technology have revolutionized
   electronic healthcare research and industry. The innovation of
   miniaturized healthcare sensors for monitoring patient vital signs has
   improved and secured the human healthcare system. The increase in
   portable health devices has enhanced the quality of health-monitoring
   status both at an activity/fitness level for self-health tracking and at
   a medical level, providing more data to clinicians with potential for
   earlier diagnosis and guidance of treatment. When sharing personal
   medical information, data security and comfort are essential
   requirements for interaction with and collection of electronic medical
   records. However, it is hard for current systems to meet these
   requirements because they have inconsistent security policies and access
   control structures. The new solutions should be directed towards
   improving data access, and should be managed by the government in terms
   of privacy and security requirements to ensure the reliability of data
   for medical purposes. Blockchain paves the way for a revolution in the
   traditional pharmaceutical industry and benefits from unique features
   such as privacy and transparency of data. In this paper, we propose a
   novel platform for monitoring patient vital signs using smart contracts
   based on blockchain. The proposed system is designed and developed using
   hyperledger fabric, which is an enterprise-distributed ledger framework
   for developing blockchain-based applications. This approach provides
   several benefits to the patients, such as an extensive, immutable
   history log, and global access to medical information from anywhere at
   any time. The Libelium e-Health toolkit is used to acquire physiological
   data. The performance of the designed and developed system is evaluated
   in terms of transaction per second, transaction latency, and resource
   utilization using a standard benchmark tool known as Hyperledger
   Caliper. It is found that the proposed system outperforms the
   traditional health care system for monitoring patient data.},

Abstract = {India, a global leader in manufacturing and the largest supplier of
   cost-effective generic drugs around the world, especially to the African
   countries under the United Nations aid, is facing a widespread fake drug
   epidemic. One of the major reasons behind this is the unregulated and
   complex drug supply chain. When a drug consignment change ownership from
   manufacturer to distributor and then to the wholesaler, no information
   is exchanged between the parties. We lack adequate auditability and
   transparency of the original source of drugs. Consequences include
   counterfeit drug problem, inefficient recall process of the drugs and
   lack of trust. By putting the entire drug supply chain of India on
   Blockchain, we propose to perform a quantitative analysis on leveraging
   unique blockchain properties like authenticity, accountability, and
   ability to handle sensitive information to solve India's counterfeit
   drugs problem permanently. It will strengthen the supply chain and will
   introduce the much-needed transparency of transactions and quality
   assurance by tracking a drug through its entire lifecycle from the
   extraction of raw materials to the patient taking the drug. Along with
   this, smart contracts can be deployed which will provide automation,
   trust, and security to the system. Smart contracts are digital protocols
   that can be programmed to perform a task when a particular goal is
   reached without any intervention of a third party and can facilitate
   services like automatic payments, quality control, and trust between
   stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Blockchain technology radically transforms resource management
   mechanisms at any level and scope of activity, making them highly
   productive, perfect, and efficient. The purpose of this paper is to
   consider the prospects for the application of blockchain technology in
   healthcare for the supply chain management. The essence of the
   blockchain as a systematized database stored on more than one server
   corresponds to the tasks of modern healthcare. An additional advantage
   is the accumulation of information in information blocks, which allows
   creating chains of interdependent blocks that are duplicated on all
   computers in the system. Based on the analysis of scientific literature,
   the paper explores the concept of blockchain and identifies the benefits
   of blockchain technology for healthcare. Based on the expert survey, the
   authors have identified the stages of the supply chain management
   process using blockchain technology in healthcare and presented the
   possibilities of blockchain technology in supply chain management in
   healthcare. The study concludes that blockchain technology will
   transform the healthcare system, not only bringing transparency into the
   supply chain management process but also improving the safety of
   healthcare.},

Abstract = {This research explores the role of Blockchain Technology (BCT)
   integrated with Reverse Supply Chain Networks (RSCN) and evaluates the
   relationship between BCT and sustainability performance. A qualitative
   research design was employed to develop a conceptual framework for BCT
   in RSCN. This research collected and analysed primary and secondary data
   from four cases as focal-actors. These focal-actors are from
   multi-industries in Jordan, namely food, pharmaceuticals, electronics,
   and toys. These actors are lead-firms and have experience working with
   RSCNs and technology applications such as BCT. Primary data were
   acquired from interviews with managers working in these industries,
   which were supported by the analysis of secondary data that identified
   two types of themes: internally focused and externally focused
   BCT-integrated drivers of RSCNs. The analysis also identified how they
   leverage sustainability performance improvements, including their use of
   RSCN approaches and features. This research is one of the few attempts
   to explore BCT integrated into RSCN for better sustainability
   performance that contributes to the theoretical and practical knowledge
   of supply chains within emerging economies. All types of
   actors-as-stakeholders involved with national programs and projects can
   adopt the new framework. The key findings contribute to the field of
   RSCN where the adoption of BCT as a broad-based strategy to attain
   sustainability goals and reverse chain activities along the supply chain
   is a goal.},

Abstract = {Blockchain Technology, the fundamental technology behind Bitcoin, has
   drawn considerable recognition ever since its origin. Its potential has
   gained significant interest in various applications, varying from the
   music industry, financial services, Internet-of-Things (IoT), smart
   grid, edge computing, cybersecurity, and the healthcare industry.
   However, the information is divided amongst several intermediaries
   involved with adverse impacts on data quality in the healthcare domain.
   In the near future, blockchain technology can reshape the way the
   healthcare industry works by providing personalized and reliable patient
   data management, reforming the traditional healthcare practices, secure
   mechanisms for data sharing, efficient pharmaceutical supply chain
   management, and drug traceability and many more. In this study, an
   extensive literature review has been provided that includes the
   different prospects of using blockchain technology in healthcare. The
   review investigates the work done to enable the amalgamation of IoT and
   Blockchain in the health ecosystem. Significant blockchain-based
   healthcare use cases such as data storage, data sharing, drug
   traceability, clinical trials, and remote patient monitoring are
   investigated. Further, the Internet of Things and blockchain
   technology-based SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat)
   analysis and the challenges linked in the healthcare domain because of
   the enactment of IoT and blockchain technology are discussed to support
   advanced studies in this domain.},

Abstract = {Background: This study presents a comprehensive review of blockchain
   technology with a sustainability orientation in supply chains and
   logistics. Methods: The publications are extracted from the Scopus and
   Web of Science databases, comprising 552 publications between 2017 and
   2022. Several bibliometric laws and techniques, namely three-field
   analysis, Bradford's Law, Lotka's Law, and thematic maps, are applied in
   R with the bibliometrix package. Content analysis is also carried out
   based on 185 publications to appreciate the industry-based view of the
   field. Results: The bibliometric results indicate that this field is on
   the rise. Authors, sources, affiliations, countries, keywords, and their
   relationships are also addressed. The findings of the content analysis
   and thematic maps reveal that some of the most highlighted themes in the
   literature include traceability, COVID-19, the internet of things, and
   Industry 4.0. The most popular industry in this field is discovered to
   be food and agriculture. Conclusions: This paper contributes to the
   still relatively scarce literature on how blockchain technology fosters
   sustainable supply chains and logistics, providing a closer look at
   blockchain use, methodologies, and future directions for different
   industries concerning food, agriculture, fashion, textile and apparel,
   manufacturing, automotive, maritime and shipping, healthcare and
   pharmaceutical, mining and mineral, and energy.},

Abstract = {On March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared a
   global pandemic. With no treatment or vaccine available at the time, it
   was necessary to rely on non-pharmaceutical methods for case
   identification and contact tracing. This kind of approach has good
   results in detecting and preventing tuberculosis, sexually transmitted
   infections, and vaccine-preventable diseases. Contact tracing and
   keeping safe distances are crucial to containing the spread of COVID-19.
   Nonetheless, contact tracing is a complex intervention, it involves
   quarantining and investigating close contacts. Manual contact tracing
   methods are slow, require a large amount of effort, and more often than
   not rely on the memory or assumptions of individuals. To combat these
   downsides, contact tracing applications were developed, resulting in
   quicker and more reliable recognition of infected individuals. However,
   because of the complex nature of these applications and their lack of
   transparency, a large portion of the population started doubting the
   privacy of the data collected. Soon after, many of these applications
   started to dwindle in the user department, which caused a feedback loop.
   ``If fewer people are using the application, the application itself
   becomes useless, and there is no longer a reason to use it.{''} Is clear
   that the main issue behind their downfall was an overwhelming lack of
   trust. In response, this paper will analyze how the use of blockchain
   technology can help the development of a more transparent application.
   And describe how a proof of work based on this concept was implemented.
   On the same note, it will also approach why was Hyperledger Sawtooth
   chosen, instead of more popular solutions such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.},

   Information Sharing for Pharma Supply Chain},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Pharmaceutical establishments are surfacing problems in tracking their
   medical products during the supply chain process, conceding that
   counterfeiters or the fake persons add their fake medicines into the
   market. The existing authentication techniques are in high demand for
   unauthorized access to sensitive drug information. The blockchain has
   the full capability to control and track the supply chain process very
   significantly. A deep learning-based pharmaceutical supply chain method
   called Epsilon Greedy Consensus-based Hadamard Deep Authentication
   (EGC-HDA) is proposed. The pharmaceutical supply chain management is
   deployed using Epsilon Greedy Consensus Block Validation which is
   capable of continuously monitoring and validating each block. Then, the
   Hadamard Gradient LSTM Authentication scheme is employed for
   authenticating blocks or the users (i.e., manufacturers, distributors,
   and resellers) in the deep learning module to do robust authentication.
   Security analysis of the proposed method is robust which attains
   performance in authentication time, latency, as well as true positive
   rate. In the experimental analysis, the results reveal that the EGC-HDA
   technique performs better with a 6\% improvement in latency and true
   positive rate by 24\%, and 7\%, faster authentication time by 42\% for
   the pharmaceutical supply chain compared to existing works.},

Abstract = {Multi-stakeholder and organizational involvement is an integral part of
   the medicine supply chain. Keeping track of the activities associated
   with medical products is difficult when the system is complex. Their
   complexity limits transparency and data provenance. Deficiencies within
   existing supply chains result in the counterfeiting of drugs, illegal
   imports, and inefficient operations. Due to these limitations, product
   integrity is compromised, resulting in product wastage. Visibility of
   the entire product supply chain is crucial for the pharmaceutical
   industry in terms of product safety and reduction of manufacturing
   costs. The Cloud-based Blockchain-powered architecture of the system
   provides a platform for addressing the need of pharma-material
   traceability, data storage, privacy of data, and quality assurance. This
   framework comprises of the identification of activities through tagging,
   information sharing in a secure environment; cloud-based storage using
   an off-chain Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and an on-chain couch DB;
   and access to this information that is controlled by the system's
   regulator. Electronic drug records will be accessed via a smart contract
   in Hyperledger Blockchain. The system assists in identifying false and
   cross-border products through the manufacturer and country of origin. A
   scan will identify counterfeit medications, showing that they are
   unauthorized products which may pose a risk to patients. Our experiments
   demonstrated the efficiency and usability of the design platform.
   Finally, we benchmarked the system using Hyperledger Caliper.},

Title = {MB-BC: Drug Traceability System Based on Multibranched Blockchain
   Structure},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 25},
Abstract = {The establishment of a complete drug traceability system is essentially
   important for public drug security and the business of pharmaceutical
   companies which is aimed at tracking where the drug has gone along the
   drug supply chain. Traditional centralized server-client technical
   solutions have been far from satisfaction for their bad performances in
   data authenticity, privacy, system resilience, and flexibility. In this
   paper, we propose a drug traceability scheme called MB-BC, which
   realizes the security and traceability of drug data through a novel
   multibranched blockchain scheme. Different from the characteristics of
   transparency of traditional blockchains, MB-BC realizes fine-grained
   access control of data between all levels in the system, which improves
   the security and privacy of data. MB-BC has further improved the
   existing consensus mechanism, strengthened the supervision of
   pharmaceutical companies, and further improved the safety and robustness
   of the system. Furthermore, the system combines data access strategies
   with smart contracts; each branch chain can also issue its smart
   contract to provide personalized services. Finally, security and
   performance evaluations show that the solution is advantageous in terms
   of data security, system robustness, supervisibility, and traceability,
   as well as efficient in terms of blockchain throughput, data query time,
   and blockchain consensus consumptions, compared with other typical
   approaches.},

Title = {Framework to enable pharmacist access to health care data using

Abstract = {Background: Decentralization and authentication are embedded in
   blockchain technology, which utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to
   ensure seamless sharing of data among different health care providers
   while safeguarding data privacy. Although community pharmacists are
   highly accessible to patients and possess robust clinical knowledge,
   they are limited in the clinical services they can provide owing to
   their lack of access to patient health records. We proposed a
   blockchain- and AI-based conceptual framework by performing a scoping
   review of successful blockchain integration in health systems.
   Objective: To formulate a conceptual framework based on a scoping review
   to improve access to health care data in the community pharmacy setting
   through the adoption of blockchain technology and AI.
   Methods: We performed a scoping review of literature based on Preferred
   Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses review criteria
   to identify the specific areas where blockchain can be implemented in
   health systems. We utilized the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process (PPCP)
   to identify 2 critical areas for blockchain integration that can support
   community pharmacists to access patient electronic health records and
   implement patient-specific information in clinical decision-making.
   Results: We included 7 articles out of 70 articles in our final review.
   The 2 areas in the PPCP identified for the use of blockchain on the
   basis of the literature review were ``Assess{''} and ``Implement.{''}
   Our proposed model involves pharmacists using AI and blockchain
   technology to comprehensively assess any concerns with the prescribed
   medication through access to laboratory results for patients and then
   implement a plan based on a comprehensive assessment of the patient's
   health record.
   Conclusions: Utilizing blockchain to securely share health data with
   community pharmacies has the potential to improve patient outcomes,
   optimize medication safety, and amplify pharmacists' roles in patient
   care. Future research should focus on implementing the model in the
   real-world settings. (C) 2022 American Pharmacists Association (R).

Abstract = {Medical health insurance fraud has been a major concern for the
   healthcare industry and governmental institutions. In the United States,
   the health insurance companies recorded a loss of tens of billions
   yearly due to healthcare fraud. Some types of fraud are at the risk of
   the patient's health. This is because the system that performs the
   manual processing of medical insurance claims frequently misses the
   endorsement of some stakeholders (such as the patient, pharmaceutical
   companies, wholesale dealers, and medical equipment suppliers) in a
   claim's validation process. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed
   system that can enable the validation of healthcare claims in a secure,
   immutable, and transparent manner. We present a taxonomy of healthcare
   insurance claims frauds, and we propose and evaluate a blockchain-based
   healthcare insurance claims fraud detection framework.},

Title = {``The first mile problem{''}: Deriving an endogenous demand for auditing
   in blockchain-based business processes},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this paper, we model the business process within which blockchain
   applications operate in order to extract an endogenous demand for
   auditing in that environment. We begin by undertaking a case study of
   the pharmaceutical drug industry supply chain, exploring both the
   proposed blockchain initiatives in it initiated by the FDA and startup
   companies, and the problems in the supply chain that blockchain cannot
   address. Drawing on this analysis, we derive an endogenous demand for
   auditing to overcome what we label the ``first mile problem{''} (FMP)
   with blockchains: ensuring that the data stored on the blockchain
   distributed ledger is isomorphic with the real life data that it
   purports to represent. The first mile problem arises only when the
   blockchain is used to store data about physical items, especially ones
   involving a service component, rather than being native digital, as is
   the case with the genesis blockchain application, bitcoin. We show that
   unless it is feasible to store a ``digital twin{''} of the item
   (Roberts, 2017), there is a role for auditors, with the training in
   professional skepticism, to help alleviate the first mile problem. There
   is no guarantee, however, that this new demand for auditing will be met
   by the traditional financial statement auditors. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Logistics services involve a wide range of transport operations between
   distributors and clients. Currently, the large number of intermediaries
   are a challenge for this sector, as it makes all the processes more
   complicated. To face that problem, we propose a system that uses smart
   contracts to remove intermediaries and speed up logistics activities.
   Our new model combines smart contracts and a multi-agent system in a
   single platform to improve the current logistics system by increasing
   organization, security and getting rid of several human intermediaries
   to automate its processes, making distribution times significantly
   faster. Also, with this kind of approach, it is possible to apply
   penalties to parties that do not comply with the terms of using this
   platform.},

Abstract = {Blockchain technology provides a platform for the decentralized
   execution of smart contracts. A smart contract is an agreement that is
   automatically executed when certain conditions are met. Current smart
   contracts use business rules to express conditions in which transactions
   occur but lack the capability to reason over time. We present a
   model-driven approach for creating blockchain applications that can run
   temporal logic. We present the new concepts required at the model level
   and explain how these concepts can be translated to a blockchain
   solution applying Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Composer, and PROTON
   complex event processing. We illustrate the approach using a pharma cold
   chain scenario. Cold chain scenarios are typical examples of blockchain
   cases in which temporal reasoning is required. Here, the blockchain
   provides transparency, a non-repudiation process, full traceability and
   trackability of the transactions (provenance), shorter lead times, and
   authentication and verification of the parties in the supply chain
   network at each asset transfer. The temporal reasoning is required since
   decisions about pharmaceutical quality is based on time windows in which
   the goods have been exposed to certain conditions. Our solution includes
   the model, the blockchain backend, and a mobile user interface that
   allows each certified and authorized party in the network to initiate
   actions, finish their transactions, and track progress. It also includes
   temperature monitoring to ensure compliance with the proper conditions
   for transportation and asset transfer.},

Abstract = {Traceability has become a critical element in supply chain management,
   particularly in safety-sensitive sectors like food, pharmaceuticals,
   etc. Upstream (manufacturers, producers, etc.) and downstream
   (distributors, wholesalers, etc.) supply chain members need to store and
   handle traceability-related information for providing proof of
   regulatory compliance to both state authorities and more demanding
   customers. More specifically, European Union regulations mandate food
   producers to trace all raw materials/ingredients used throughout their
   supply chain operations. Consumers also place high expectations on food
   supply chains (FSC) with specific emphasis on facets related to safety.
   However, the complexity of modern FSC networks and their fragmentation
   act as barriers for the development of sound traceability mechanisms.
   This paper aims to develop a distributed functional model to provide
   decentralized and automated FSC traceability based on blockchain
   technology and smart contracts. For assessing the feasibility of the
   proposed modeling approach, a food traceability use-case scenario is
   presented. The applicability of the model is further illustrated by the
   development of a fully functional smart contract and a local private
   blockchain. The overall benefits of the proposed model are assessed
   based on a set of predefined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The
   results are of significant value to both practitioners and researchers.

Abstract = {To tackle the devastating issue of drug counterfeiting, the US Food and
   Drug Administration (FDA) has initiated a pilot project in which 24
   companies in the pharmaceutical supply chain use blockchain technology
   to track and trace drug deliveries among manufacturers, distributors,
   hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. Although embracing new and powerful
   technologies is a meaningful step toward eliminating the shadow of
   deadly drug counterfeiting, powerful governments, and pharmaceutical
   giants can also take other steps to fight against drug counterfeiting.
   These may include helping to establish the blockchain infrastructure in
   low-income and underdeveloped countries, providing free or affordable
   original drug products to low-income countries, and allowing local drug
   manufacturers across the globe to manufacture affordable comparable
   products.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 vaccinations have been approved for public immunization and are
   going through clinical trials. Vaccinating a billion people of India is
   a huge challenge. Tracing, last mile delivery, data privacy, double
   spend of dosage, and multiparty authorization pose serious challenges
   for providing COVID-19 vaccines. Policies have been framed on who gets
   the access to the vaccine. However, there is a need of a technological
   solution to create an efficient vaccine distribution or delivery system.
   This paper proposes a novel blockchain enabled vaccine delivery system
   in the context of India. A consortium blockchain has been proposed which
   has different participants, like the UIDAI, healthcare facilities,
   pharmaceutical supply chain, etc. These participants are responsible for
   authenticating the beneficiary of the COVID-19 vaccine. Sequence diagram
   of how the beneficiary is authorized to access the vaccine has been
   proposed.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in technology have drastically downsized costs and
   implementation times for genomic services. The wide availability of
   low-cost genomic technologies and the easy access to genomic data can
   significantly improve the productivity and efficiency of healthcare, all
   to the benefit of social well-being in general. For example, by creating
   the conditions for researchers to identify the causes of multiple
   diseases and by contributing to the development of new drugs, we can
   improve the quality of life and give people, as users of genomic
   services, the means to positively impact their health. This article
   describes how blockchain technology can lay the foundations of an
   ecosystem that encourages users to acquire and share their genomic data
   in full awareness and without fear of being circumvented, so as to
   participate in the benefits and advances in genomic research. The
   starting point is Genesy, an innovative blockchain platform that
   transcribes genomic data, thus facilitating and at the same time
   safeguarding the users of genomic services in their relationships with
   parties interested in accessing and using data they own, such as
   research centers, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, geneticists. This
   result is obtained by exploiting the capabilities of blockchain
   technology to notarize data and prevent their unauthorized use, and at
   the same time to make them objects of possible transactions between
   different parties. Looking ahead, the Genesy model can be generalized to
   promote an ecosystem, and a fair market, of all types of biomedical
   data.},

Abstract = {The modern era of information and technology leverages connectivity and
   information sharing for enhancing applications and reducing human
   intervention. The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) in almost
   all aspects of modern life raises major challenges of security and
   privacy in health care services and the pharmaceutical industry.
   Blockchain has emerged as a secure technology in a trustless network
   without central governance. The inherent attributes it provides can
   solve the security and privacy challenges related to IoT and extend its
   capabilities. However, traditional instances of Blockchain are not
   suited for the IoT environment for reasons such as computationally
   expensive consensus process. Proof of authentication is a lightweight
   consensus algorithm that can be implemented in the IoT environment. This
   paper presents an IoT-friendly Blockchain scheme implemented to evaluate
   the feasibility of medical supply and drug transportation to aid
   security and mitigate privacy issues which are fault-tolerant,
   transparent, and traceable. The proof of concept implementation on
   portable single board computer demonstrates proof of authentication
   consensus algorithm executed with block validation and block addition in
   30 and 40 ms while consuming 45 and 60mJ, respectively. Additionally,
   the network performance of the proposed architecture was presented and
   evaluated in the application context.},

Abstract = {The advent of blockchain technology has transformed traditional business
   processes from centralized to decentralized. By eliminating the
   unnecessary intervention of middlemen, it can reduce the overall cost of
   patient medication by turning the drug supply chain entirely into a
   point-to-point decentralized business. This paper presents a reliable
   and encouraging P2P drug trading block chain technology and four related
   smart contracts. These contracts include consumer contracts and the
   supply, bidding and trading of drugs, which have been deployed on the
   Ethereum blockchain for the decentralized trading of drugs. We will use
   the Approach of Real cost descending (RCD) to achieve incentive
   transactions for suppliers and patients. This method provides P2P
   transactions and ensures the safety and transparency of drug data, as
   well as the anonymity of users in the transaction process. Finally,
   according to the requirements of Good Supplying Practice(GSP), the
   effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated and analyzed.},

Abstract = {The unprecedented growth of decentralized technologies and the abundance
   of healthcare data creates numerous opportunities for the digital
   healthcare industry and poses major challenges for data security. In
   this paper, we propose a novel decentralized blockchain-based medical
   data marketplace in which medical record sellers can sell their data to
   interested buyers, e.g., pharmaceutical corporations. Sellers use a
   smart contract to exchange their records with buyers for a digital
   currency. In our model, sellers can enforce flexible access control
   policy on the encrypted records while allowing the buyers to verify the
   correctness of the encrypted records without revealing any information
   about the records using the developed zk-SNARK protocol. In addition,
   sellers acquire a proof-of-delivery to redeem buyers' contingent
   payments by exchanging a record access key for a buyer signature using
   the developed trustless zero-knowledge contingent payment protocol. Our
   security analysis proves that our model is secure against malicious
   behaviors of both dishonest sellers/buyers. Performance evaluation
   indicates that the GAS cost on Etherume blockchain and the computational
   cost of the cryptographic operations are low.},

Title = {Getting along with frenemies: enhancing multi-competitor coopetition
   governance through artificial intelligence and blockchain},
Journal = {INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION},
Abstract = {Collaborating with one competitor is difficult but collaborating with
   several competitors is a monumental challenge. However, multi-competitor
   coopetition, or cooperation between multiple competitors, is increasing.
   This study examines how recent advancements in artificial intelligence
   (AI) and blockchain can support multi-competitor coopetition by
   enhancing governance. Examining two coopetitive R\&D consortia in
   pharmaceuticals and medical imaging, we find that a nascent form of AI
   called federated learning can address key coopetition concerns such
   proprietary and confidential data protection, knowledge leakage, data
   sovereignty and silos thereby maintaining organisational boundaries and
   autonomy. The use of federated learning and blockchain increases
   transparency and accountability, which reduces information asymmetries
   and power differential inequities. Together, these technologies
   decentralise governance and authority, reducing the tension between
   collective value creation and individual value appropriation inherent in
   coopetition, particularly those with multiple competitors. Finally, this
   study illustrates how emerging technologies challenge traditional
   assumptions about organisational boundaries, distributed innovation, and
   coopetition.},

   Sharing for Pharma Supply Chain},

Abstract = {Counterfeit drugs are forgery-tagged medicines that are considered to be
   drugs without vigorous active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). India,
   being the world's largest producer of drugs, faces a crucial issue of
   counterfeits. Moreover, counterfeits identify their path into the
   pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) effortlessly owing to the dearth of
   security and traceability in the prevailing system. This is because the
   software applications currently in use stockpile the information about
   drugs on centralized servers and are accessed by manufacturers,
   distributors and retailers via the internet. The security of such
   systems is found to be weak. To address these issues, in this work, a
   novel method called Supersingular Isogeny and Hosmer-Lemeshow Logistic
   Regression-based (SI-HLLR) secured information sharing for the
   pharmaceutical supply chain is proposed. The SI-HLLR method is split
   into two sections, block validation and authentication. First, with the
   pharmaceutical sales data provided as input, the supersingular isogeny
   Diffie-Hellman key exchange model is applied for block validation and
   then is implemented using a blockchain. Next, with the validated blocks,
   the authentication mechanism is performed using Hosmer-Lemeshow logistic
   regression-based authentication that in turn eliminates the counterfeit
   drugs from the pharmaceutical supply chain. The hyperledger fabric
   blockchain solution using SI-HLLR leads to improved security ensuring
   data integrity and better authentication accuracy in the proposed
   method.},

Abstract = {Due to the huge potential in gene expression analysis, which is helpful
   for disease diagnosis, new drug development, and life science research,
   the two-way clustering algorithm was proposed and it was widely used in
   gene expression data research. In order to understand the economic data
   of medical and health industry, this paper analyzes the economic data of
   the medical and health industry in different regions of China based on
   blockchain technology and two-way spectral cluster analysis and makes
   statistics on the economic data of the medical and health industry in
   eastern, central, and western regions of China. This paper studies the
   development status of China's medical and health industry and the
   factors affecting the agglomeration of medical and health service
   industry and analyzes them under the blockchain technology and two-way
   spectral cluster analysis method. The results show that the overall
   development trend of China's medicine and health is from government-led
   to government, society, and individual sharing. After the transformation
   of blockchain technology and two-way spectral cluster analysis, the
   output value of the pharmaceutical industry increased by about 10\%.},

Abstract = {Real-time tracking and surveillance of patients' health has become
   ubiquitous in the healthcare sector as a result of the development of
   fog, cloud computing, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Medical
   IoT (MIoT) equipment often transfers health data to a pharmaceutical
   data center, where it is saved, evaluated, and made available to
   relevant stakeholders or users. Fog layers have been utilized to
   increase the scalability and flexibility of IoT-based healthcare
   services, by providing quick response times and low latency. Our
   proposed solution focuses on an electronic healthcare system that
   manages both critical and non-critical patients simultaneously. Fog
   layer is distributed into two halves: critical fog cluster and
   non-critical fog cluster. Critical patients are handled at critical fog
   clusters for quick response, while non-critical patients are handled
   using blockchain technology at non-critical fog cluster, which protects
   the privacy of patient health records. The suggested solution requires
   little modification to the current IoT ecosystem while decrease the
   response time for critical messages and offloading the cloud
   infrastructure. Reduced storage requirements for cloud data centers
   benefit users in addition to saving money on construction and operating
   expenses. In addition, we examined the proposed work for recall,
   accuracy, precision, and F-score. The results show that the suggested
   approach is successful in protecting privacy while retaining standard
   network settings. Moreover, suggested system and benchmark are evaluated
   in terms of system response time, drop rate, throughput, fog, and cloud
   utilization. Evaluated results clearly indicate the performance of
   proposed system is better than benchmark.},

Title = {A Distributed Ledger for Supply Chain Physical Distribution Visibility},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Supply chains (SC) span many geographies, modes and industries and
   involve several phases where data flows in both directions from
   suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, to customers. This
   data flow is necessary to support critical business decisions that may
   impact product cost and market share. Current SC information systems are
   unable to provide validated, pseudo real-time shipment tracking during
   the distribution phase. This information is available from a single
   source, often the carrier, and is shared with other stakeholders on an
   as-needed basis. This paper introduces an independent, crowd-validated,
   online shipment tracking framework that complements current
   enterprise-based SC management solutions. The proposed framework
   consists of a set of private distributed ledgers and a single blockchain
   public ledger. Each private ledger allows the private sharing of custody
   events among the trading partners in a given shipment. Privacy is
   necessary, for example, when trading high-end products or chemical and
   pharmaceutical products. The second type of ledger is a blockchain
   public ledger. It consists of the hash code of each private event in
   addition to monitoring events. The latter provide an independently
   validated immutable record of the pseudo real-time geolocation status of
   the shipment from a large number of sources using commuters-sourcing.},

Abstract = {In an IT-enabled hybrid social startup, how and why does the social
   entrepreneur respond to conflicting commercial versus social norms and
   practices, as well as IT innovation challenges? We conducted an
   exploratory single-case study of an IT-enabled hybrid social startup
   consisting of a charitable pharmacy, two non-profit consortia, and two
   for-profit IT businesses, all co-founded by a pharmacist/social
   entrepreneur (with partners) who aimed to distribute donated
   ``wasted{''} medications to needy patients. The two for- profit
   organizations were designing a blockchain and complementary web and
   mobile applications for secure, cost-effective donated-drug
   distribution, for use by this entrepreneur's charitable pharmacy and
   other organizations committed to matching donors with needy patients.
   Study findings suggests that multiple forms of IT agility, multiple
   forms of business agility, and a unique form of socialcommercial agility
   help an IT-enabled hybrid social startup persist, despite financial and
   other challenges.},

Abstract = {Rapid technological evolve brings grate changes. As technology advances
   it replaces the old way of working or doing things. With the electronic
   format of paper work, efforts of organizations are greatly reduces. But
   it give rise to new problems i.e. how to store, access and update the
   records. As the data is available online, it may affect data's privacy
   and security. A health care domain greatly advances with new
   innovations. The documents can be saved easily and access everywhere. A
   patient and organization can effectively use this system to access his
   medical records, medical history and currently prescribe medicines. It
   gives patient as well as his family to easily access the data, sharing
   of medical reports and use of signed prescription at pharmacy anytime
   anywhere. The data should be available but need to take care of data
   security and privacy. The patient must be the owner of data. Using
   blockchain technology, data will be available in decentralized manner.
   Using digitize signature the authentication of data can be verified.
   With the use of cryptography, data will be secure. While consensuses
   algorithm used for the reliability in a network. The system provides
   privacy using privacy agreement storage. Only with the permission from
   the patient or authorized person the data can be used. Owner will be
   able to see, who is using his data and for what purpose. The system will
   be efficient to handle the data electronically as well as effective to
   confidentiality, authenticity and patient-centric.},

Abstract = {Drug counterfeiting is a serious and increasing critical issue
   worldwide, which puts the health of consumers and the general population
   at risk. WHO estimates that the world's counterfeit drug market make
   billions of dollars annually. It is due to the inadequate supply chain
   in the developing countries that one in the drug is counterfeit. People
   buying such medicines not only waste their money but also put their life
   and health in danger. A drug's ownership changes from manufacturer to
   distributor and then to the pharmacist before reaching the customer. The
   manufacturers don't know how their drug is being used. At the same time,
   consumers don't know whether the drug has come from the rightful source.
   It is due to the counterfeit drug in the supply chain manufacturing
   companies and countries face huge economic loss. The RFID technology has
   been effective for over a decade providing anti-counterfeit measures to
   the supply chain. However, the RFID tags cannot be guaranteed
   genuineness, since the tags can be cloned easily. In this paper, we
   propose how blockchain can be utilized to not only prevent drug
   counterfeiting but also add traceability, security, and visibility to
   the pharmaceutical supply chain. For this purpose, a permissioned
   blockchain is designed to which only trusted parties can join the
   network and push transactions to the blockchain.},

Title = {Governing the Digital Economy: An Exploration of Blockchains with
   Chinese Characteristics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ASIA},
Abstract = {In 2019 President Xi Jinping called for the prioritisation of blockchain
   technology as part of China's next phase of development. In China,
   blockchain technologies have been experimentally deployed in various
   areas including court records, securities exchanges, finance, and food
   supply chains. The emergence of blockchain as a governmental technology
   raises numerous questions, including: (i) what are the conditions of
   emergence and existence of China's interest in blockchain technology?
   (ii) what are the features of ``blockchains with Chinese
   characteristics{''}? (iii) what implications are there for the
   post-COVID-19 pandemic world, in which technological issues are likely
   to be pivotal points of contention? This article seeks to examine these
   questions and frame a research programme that can shed light on how
   blockchains may impact the evolution and shape of China's social and
   economic structure and the interaction of China with the rest of the
   world, including the prospect of ``decoupling{''} and
   ``deglobalisation.{''} Examples of blockchain innovation are drawn from
   food and pharmaceutical supply chains, the Healthy China 2030 policy,
   the digital RMB/Yuan and the Belt and Road Initiative with attention to
   the emerging legal and institutional frames that support the application
   of blockchain technologies.},

Abstract = {Counterfeit drugs are a serious issue nowadays, which has been burdening
   for developing countries and has a significant impact on the health of
   people. The Indian drug regulatory agency has published the details of
   the counterfeited products found in recent years, the data indicates an
   alarming situation in the country to achieve a well-becoming level of
   attention between policymakers, researchers and the pharmaceutical
   industry. The present paper shows a thorough review of relevant and
   incidental literature from different agencies to reach the
   counterfeiting of drugs, its type, statistics, incidents and deficiency
   in Indian regulation. Different country regulations like U.S, Europe and
   Canada have also discussed in comparison with Indian regulation which
   shows that how India should adopt the technologies present in other
   countries to combat counterfeit medicine. Different technologies exist
   for prevention for counterfeitings of drugs like overt, covert and trace
   and track technologies; serialization and blockchain. In this article,
   the main focus is given on serialization and blockchain which will help
   from entering the counterfeit drugs into the supply chain because of
   unique code put on each box of drugs to trace them.},

Abstract = {Supply chain in industry is a flow of information and goods traversal
   through multiple suppliers such as raw material suppliers,
   manufacturers, distributors, retailers and end users. Supply chain
   management (SCM) helps in smooth monitoring and accounting of
   information and goods traversal among multiple users. However, the
   existing supply chain management processes lack in offering transparency
   of information, user's privacy, timely updates on demand peaks, improper
   tracing of information, quality management, deal repudiation and trust
   among users. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework for
   pharmaceutical supply chain management which uses an ethereum
   blockchain, a distributed ledger technology. We propose different smart
   contracts to manage pharmaceutical supply chain processes over an
   ethereum blockchain. This framework helps in achieving user privacy,
   transparency of the supplied drug, tracking of drugs, quality
   management, non-repudiation and demand supply management with the
   improved trust among the users. At the end, we analyze the proposed
   framework in terms of fulfilling the pharmaceutical supply chain
   management requirements.},

Abstract = {Production lines in pharmaceutical manufacturing generate numerous
   heterogeneous data sets from various embedded systems which control the
   multiple processes of medicine production. Such data sets should
   arguably ensure end-to-end traceability and data integrity in order to
   release a medicine batch, which is uniquely identified and tracked by
   its batch number/code. Consequently, auditable computerised systems are
   crucial on pharmaceutical production lines, since the industry is
   becoming increasingly regulated for product quality and patient health
   purposes. This paper describes the EUfunded SPuMoNI project, which aims
   to ensure the quality of large amounts of data produced by computerised
   production systems in representative pharmaceutical environments. Our
   initial results include significant progress in: (i) end-to-end
   verification taking advantage of blockchain properties and smart
   contracts to ensure data authenticity, transparency, and immutability;
   (ii) data quality assessment models to identify data behavioural
   patterns that can violate industry practices and/or international
   regulations; and (iii) intelligent agents to collect and manipulate data
   as well as perform smart decisions. By analysing multiple sensors in
   medicine production lines, manufacturing work centres, and quality
   control laboratories, our approach has been initially evaluated using
   representative industry grade pharmaceutical manufacturing data sets
   generated at an IT environment with regulated processes inspected by
   regulatory and government agencies. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {The future of community pharmacy has always been a matter of concern for
   academics and practitioners alike. Recently, a paper published in this
   Journal brought to the discussion the importance of new technologies,
   such as Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, and the emergence of
   market forces like Amazon or Google, to the future of the pharmacy
   profession. In this commentary, we offer our view about the subject,
   specifically focusing in the practice area of Community Pharmacy. Our
   choice takes into account the fact that this by far the most numerous
   group within the profession, and where the fear of redundancy has always
   been looming since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Envisioned
   technologies will become a reality, but by now are not mature enough to
   be the disrupters everyone expects. Moreover, without major shifts in
   the legal environment regulating the organization of health care and the
   provision of medicines, big players will find it difficult to substitute
   pharmacies. As for pharmacists, they have always adapted to the
   challenges presented by technological revolutions. We argue that for the
   coming Patient Centred era, it is more important to continue to focus on
   the sustainability of an enhanced role for community pharmacists,
   providing services that highlight pharmacists? social role, measuring
   outcomes, and managing populations? health.},

Abstract = {Industry 4.0 is leading society into a new era characterized by smart
   communications between consumers and enterprises. While entertainment
   and fashion brands aim to consolidate their identities, increasing
   consumers' participation in new, engaging, and immersive experiences,
   other industry sectors such as food and drugs are called to adhere to
   stricter regulations to increase the quality assurance of their
   processes. The pharmaceutical industry is inherently one of the most
   regulated sectors because the safety, integrity, and conservation along
   the distribution network are the main pillars for guaranteeing the
   efficacy of drugs for the general public. Favoured by Industry 4.0
   incentives, pharmaceutical serialization has become a must in the last
   few years and is now in place worldwide. In this paper, a decentralized
   solution based on non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can improve the
   track and trace capability of the standard serialization process, is
   presented. Non-fungible tokens are minted in the blockchain and inherit
   all the advantages provided by this technology. As blockchain technology
   is becoming more and more popular, adoption of track and trace will
   increase tremendously. Focusing on the pharmaceutical industry's use of
   track and trace, this paper presents the concepts and architectural
   elements necessary to support the non-fungible token solution,
   culminating in the presentation of a use case with a prototypical
   application.},

Abstract = {As a result of the limited resources available in IoT local devices, the
   large scale cloud consumer's data that are produced by IoT related
   machines are contracted out to the cloud. Cloud computing is unreliable,
   using it can compromise user privacy, and data may be leaked. Because
   cloud-data and grid infrastructure are both growing exponentially, there
   is an urgent need to explore computational sources and cloud large-data
   protection. Numerous cloud service categories are assimilated into
   numerous fields, such as defense systems and pharmaceutical databases,
   to compute information space and allocation of resources. Attribute
   Based Encryption (ABE) is a sophisticated approach which can permit
   employees to specify a higher level of security for data stored in cloud
   storage facilities. Numerous obsolete ABE techniques are practical when
   applied to small data sets to generate cryptograms with restricted
   computational properties; their properties are used to generate the key,
   encrypt it, and decrypt it. To address the current concerns, a dynamic
   non-linear polynomial chaotic quantum hash technique on top of secure
   block chain model can be used for enhancing cloud data security while
   maintaining user privacy. In the proposed method, customer attributes
   are guaranteed by using a dynamic non- polynomial chaotic map function
   for the key initialization, encryption, and decryption. In the proposed
   model, both organized and unorganized massive clinical data are
   considered to be inputs for reliable corroboration and encoding.
   Compared to existing models, the real-time simulation results
   demonstrate that the stated standard is more precise than 90\% in terms
   of bit change and more precise than 95\% in terms of dynamic key
   generation, encipherment, and decipherment time.},

Abstract = {Globalisation has facilitated different industries to eliminate
   geographical boundaries and equipped organisations to work collectively
   to produce goods. Pharmaceuticals is one such industry which has majorly
   benefited from globalisation to reduce costs and increase profitability
   at different aspects of research, development, manufacturing of drugs
   and finally distribution of drugs. Globalisation not only reduces costs
   and increases profits for the industry, it also makes essential
   medication available to all individuals even at remote areas of
   undeveloped, developing and developed countries. As the number of
   entities or participants grew in the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain (PSC),
   the complexity and abstractness of the drug delivery from manufacturer
   to consumer has increased, which raised new concerns like counterfeit
   medication, incorrect, incomplete or no information about the drug
   reaching the consumer thus undermining customer confidence and most
   importantly distribution delays which can cause serious impact on the
   life of the consumer as well as business growth. Considering all these
   challenges, there is a dire need for a robust PSC which can eliminate
   blind parties and provide a transparent chain. A transparent PSC will
   eliminate data fragmentation between different participating entities by
   creating a trail of secure, single source of truth for the entire life
   cycle of a medicine, thereby eliminating the introduction of
   counterfeits and ensuring the consumer safety. This article proposes a
   novel Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based transparent supply chain
   for PSC and proof-of-concept is implemented to analyse the scalability
   and efficiency of the proposed architecture. Distributed Ledger
   Technology (DLT) is one of the technologies which can provide such
   transparent PSC and Smart Contracts (SC) are the most commonly used
   component in such systems to implement business logic and access control
   mechanisms. The proposed PharmaChain model investigates all the
   interactions between the main entities in PSC and also addresses smart
   contract issues such as re-entrance, randomness and lacking trustworthy
   data feed. Results are compared with other proposed solutions for PSC
   based on DLT.},

Title = {The distributed ledger technology as a measure to minimize risks of
   poor-quality pharmaceuticals circulation},
Journal = {PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {Background. In the modern world, millions of people suffer from fake and
   poor-quality medical products entering the market. Violation of the
   rules of transportation of drugs makes them ineffective and even
   dangerous. The relationship between the various parts of the supply
   chain, production and regulation of drugs is too hard and has many
   problems. Distributed ledger technology is a distributed database, the
   properties of which allow us to track the entire path of medical
   products from the manufacturer to consumer, to improve the current model
   of the supply chain, to transform the pharmaceutical industry and
   prevent falsified drugs reach the market.
   Objective. The aim of the article is to analyze the distributed ledger
   technology as an innovative means of poor-quality pharmaceuticals
   prevention to reach the market as well as their forehanded detection.
   Methods. Content analysis of web sites of companies developing
   distributed ledger technology solutions had been performed. Five
   examples found with a google search engine by keywords ``distributed
   ledger technology'', ``blockchain'', ``pharmaceuticals'' and ``supply
   chain'' were examined. Analysis of relative scientific publications had
   been made. With the help of generalization and systematization methods,
   services provided by these companies were analyzed. The visual model of
   the supply chain was created with Microsoft Visio software.
   Results. The analysis results contain a principle scheme of distributed
   ledger technology implementation to achieve the objectives. The analysis
   of present-day pharmaceuticals supply chain structure and the
   distributed ledger technology capacities to improve pharmaceutical
   companies has been carried out and presented. Furthermore, the article
   allows getting acquainted with today's projects released to the market
   as well as the prognosis of the distributed ledger technology in
   pharmaceutical industry enhancement in the future.},

Abstract = {Blockchains have received much hype lately and researchers and
   developers are seeking unique and innovative uses for this new
   technology. The medical field is no exception, specifically
   pharmaceutical uses for blockchains. To this effect, this proposed
   research aims to design a secure and efficient electronic prescription
   system leveraging blockchain technology. Using the unique properties of
   blockchains, the proposed application (RxBlock) seeks to explore how a
   blockchain could be used in electronic prescriptions. The proposed
   application creates an immutable ledger of transactions occurring over a
   network. This property of immutability provides the much-needed
   compliance and accountability for the electronic prescription system. It
   takes into consideration a simplified electronic prescription process to
   design and implement a prototype electronic prescribing system on a
   privatized Ethereum blockchain. The use of this application also seeks
   to serve as a potential Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)
   database. The goal is to enable the development of a PDMP database to
   provide the necessary attestation of the prescriptions, create
   accountability and reduce prescription overdose for patients. Evaluation
   studies of the proposed application (RxBlock) have been conducted with
   pre- and post-assessment studies at a partner nationally recognized
   HIMSS Stage 7 regional trauma center (> 600 beds) and its affiliated 31
   associated clinical practices. Results confirm that the proposed
   solution demonstrates the potential to alleviate the drug overdose
   crisis and enables the design of an effective and accountable electronic
   prescription development/monitoring system. This would effectively aid
   in improving quality and reducing cost of such healthcare service
   systems.},

Abstract = {Emerging multitenant cloud computing ecosystems allow multiple
   applications to share virtualized pool of computing and networking
   resources. As a result, such ecosystems are becoming increasingly prone
   to data privacy concerns (personal data leakages and unauthorized
   access). While cloud computing providers support robust security and
   privacy mechanisms (e.g., public key cryptography, firewalls, and
   virtual private networks, among many others), they lack mechanisms and
   frameworks to monitor, audit, and verify these data privacy concerns.
   The emergence of data protection regulations around the world, such as
   General Data Protection Regulation in Europe and the Data Protection Act
   in the U.K., further emphasizes the need to overcome these privacy
   limitations. In this article, a novel technique for monitoring,
   auditing, and verifying the operations carried out on a user's personal
   data in cloud computing ecosystems is proposed. Our research methodology
   leverages distributed ledger technologies (e.g., blockchain and smart
   contracts) for developing an immutable recording technique, which
   transparently logs, monitors, and verifies the operations carried out on
   user data. Using a healthcare pharmacy scenario and extensive real-world
   experiments, we validate the feasibility of the proposed technique. The
   proposed work handles a large pool of requests (>13K) ensuring minimal
   latency (approximate to 50-60 ms) and overheads for three different
   service packages varied with respect to the number of actors and
   operations.},

   Identifying Product Supply Chain Counterfeiting},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Counterfeiting is found today in many industries and in various forms
   with severe consequences for supply chain operations. Products
   counterfeiting can be detected in consumer goods such as clothing, food
   and beverages, accessories, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and luxury
   goods. The continuous violations in the supply chain have led to the
   need for mobilization of all involved stakeholders to overcome
   counterfeiting challenges. Effective traceability seems to be the only
   way to combat this phenomenon, ensuring safe and sustainable supply
   chain operations. This paper presents a structured literature review on
   traceability approaches for combatting the product supply chain
   counterfeiting phenomenon that led to forming a structured
   classification framework. The performed analysis aims to identify trends
   and good practices and can be used as a guideline for real-life projects
   against supply chain counterfeiting. The results show that traditional
   traceability methods are not effective as they can be easily falsified
   using today's technological advancements. However, these same
   advancements also present valuable technologies such as blockchain and
   the internet of things to ensure safe and sustainable supply chain
   operations.},

Title = {Anonymity Preserving IoT-Based COVID-19 and Other Infectious Disease
   Contact Tracing Model},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {159402-159414},
Abstract = {Automated digital contact tracing is effective and efficient, and one of
   the non-pharmaceutical complementary approaches to mitigate and manage
   epidemics like Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite the
   advantages of digital contact tracing, it is not widely used in the
   western world, including the US and Europe, due to strict privacy
   regulations and patient rights. We categorized the current approaches
   for contact tracing, namely: mobile service-provider-application, mobile
   network operators' call detail, citizen-application, and IoT-based.
   Current measures for infection control and tracing do not include
   animals and moving objects like cars despite evidence that these moving
   objects can be infection carriers. In this article, we designed and
   presented a novel privacy anonymous IoT model. We presented an RFID
   proof-of-concept for this model. Our model leverages blockchain's
   trust-oriented decentralization for on-chain data logging and retrieval.
   Our model solution will allow moving objects to receive or send
   notifications when they are close to a flagged, probable, or confirmed
   diseased case, or flagged place or object. We implemented and presented
   three prototype blockchain smart contracts for our model. We then
   simulated contract deployments and execution of functions. We presented
   the cost differentials. Our simulation results show less than one-second
   deployment and call time for smart contracts, though, in real life, it
   can be up to 25 seconds on Ethereum public blockchain. Our simulation
   results also show that it costs an average of \$1.95 to deploy our
   prototype smart contracts, and an average of \$0.34 to call our
   functions. Our model will make it easy to identify clusters of infection
   contacts and help deliver a notification for mass isolation while
   preserving individual privacy. Furthermore, it can be used to understand
   better human connectivity, model similar other infection spread network,
   and develop public policies to control the spread of COVID-19 while
   preparing for future epidemics.},

Abstract = {Goal: As the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2019/2020 unfolds, a COVID-19
   `Immunity Passport' has been mooted as a way to enable individuals to
   return back to work. While the quality of antibody testing, the
   availability of vaccines, and the likelihood of even attaining COVID-19
   immunity continue to be researched, we address the issues involved in
   providing tamper-proof and privacy-preserving certification for test
   results and vaccinations. Methods: We developed a prototype mobile phone
   app and requisite decentralized server architecture that facilitates
   instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally
   identifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and
   the app allows the end-user selectively to present only the specific
   test result with no other personal information revealed. The
   architecture, designed for scalability, relies upon (a) the 2019 World
   Wide Web Consortium standard called `Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim
   Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data platform `Solid', and (c) a
   Consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our mobile phone app and
   decentralized server architecture enable the mixture of verifiability
   and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and
   digital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of
   sensitive digital keys and/or data. Benchmark performance tests show it
   to scale linearly in the worst case, as significant processing is done
   locally on each app. For the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g.
   healthcare staff, pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g. employer), it is `just
   another app' which takes only minutes to use. Conclusions: The app and
   decentralized server architecture offer a prototype proof of concept
   that is readily scalable, applicable generically, and in effect `waiting
   in the wings' for the biological issues, plus key ethical issues raised
   in the discussion section, to be resolved.},

Abstract = {Electronic prescription (e-Prescription) is a digital way to manage
   medical prescriptions and reduce inconsistencies in the communication
   between doctors, patients, and pharmacies. Smart contracts allow the
   automation of tasks and business rules in a decentralized architecture
   (i.e., without the need for an intermediary or central authority).
   Platforms such as Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric support smart
   contracts development through a consensus mechanism such as
   Proof-of-Work or another criterion among the network's participating
   nodes. This paper explores Tendermint, a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)
   based consensus mechanism that has not yet been widely adopted for smart
   contracts platforms. We apply our devised model to the healthcare
   application domain, more precisely in the field of e-prescription, and
   our results demonstrate that smart contracts can be implemented on a
   BFT-based platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   study investigating the implementation of smart contracts in a BFT-based
   platform such as Tendermint. We exploit this domain as there can exist
   some conflicting interests of profit-taking. For example, pharmacists
   can increase the medication dosage above the one prescribed by doctors
   for profit-taking. Such a scenario can occur particularly in countries
   where healthcare is free of charge and offered as a public service
   (e.g., Brazil). We show that smart contracts in BFT-based blockchain can
   help in solving problems in these application scenarios. Finally, our
   two key contributions in this paper are two-fold: (i) exploit
   smart-contracts in BFT-based platforms where they (smart contracts) are
   not very established yet in the blockchain domain; (ii) provide a
   smart-contract-based e-prescription solution to reduce the costs (no
   need for a central authority) and scams particularly in countries where
   the medical service is free and public.},

Abstract = {Digitalisation of the healthcare sector promises to revolutionise
   patient healthcare globally. From the different technologies, virtual
   tools including artificial intelligence, blockchain, virtual, and
   augmented reality, to name but a few, are providing significant benefits
   to patients and the pharmaceutical sector alike, ranging from improving
   access to clinicians and medicines, as well as improving real-time
   diagnoses and treatments. Indeed, it is envisioned that such
   technologies will communicate together in real-time, as well as with
   their physical counterparts, to create a large-scale, cyber healthcare
   system. Despite the significant benefits that virtual-based digital
   health technologies can bring to patient care, a number of challenges
   still remain, ranging from data security to acceptance within the
   healthcare sector. This review provides a timely account of the benefits
   and challenges of virtual health interventions, as well an outlook on
   how such technologies can be transitioned from research-focused towards
   real-world healthcare and pharmaceutical applications to transform
   treatment pathways for patients worldwide. CO 2021 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Background Research failures are one of the most significant costs
   associated with the estimated USD\$2.6 billion price tag and 12-year
   time frame to bring a drug from discovery to market. The European
   Commission estimates that USD\$20 billion are spent every year to
   develop innovations that have already developed elsewhere, highlighting
   the exorbitant cost of duplication. The competitive nature of the
   pharmaceutical industry is such that the voluntary sharing of
   information is not particularly forthcoming despite the highly
   publicized advantages of open science, open access, and open innovation.
   However, sharing research failures may be perceived as less
   competitively threatening because it is considered `useless' to the
   party owning it, but highly valuable to the competition. Method A
   combination of existing legal tools and technology, such as trade secret
   protection, blockchain, and knowledge commons, may provide the necessary
   legal basis for a platform ecosystem that can incentivize and capture
   the value of sharing intellectual contributions (such as research
   failures), while protecting innovators against free-riding and
   unauthorized appropriation by third-parties. Result Not all intellectual
   efforts that contribute to the creation innovations can be protected by
   traditional forms of IP. If proprietary information necessary to create
   innovations cannot be adequately protected, innovators and researchers
   are likely to safeguard their interests at the expense of sharing.
   Conclusion A legally supported framework that proactively recognizes
   intellectual contributions by way of research failures, which can
   subsequently be translated into a revenue-sharing model, may lead to
   more openness, value creation, and overall acceleration of drug
   discovery and development.},

Abstract = {Introduction The urgent need to acquire medical supplies amidst the
   COVID-19 pandemic has led to bypassing of controls that govern the
   global pharmaceutical supply chain, increasing the risk of corruption.
   Hence, promoting anti-corruption, transparency, and accountability
   (ACTA) in supply chain and procurement has never been more important.
   The adoption of digital tools, if designed and implemented
   appropriately, can reduce the risks of corruption. Areas Covered
   Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted an interdisciplinary
   systematic review of health/medicine, humanities/social sciences,
   engineering, and computer science literature, with the aims of
   identifying technologies used for pharmaceutical supply chain and
   procurement optimization and reviewing whether they address ACTA
   mechanisms to strengthen pharmaceutical governance. Our review
   identified four distinct categories of digital solutions: e-procurement
   and open contracting; track-and-trace technology; anti-counterfeiting
   technology; and blockchain technology. Expert Opinion Findings
   demonstrate an increase in research of technologies to improve
   pharmaceutical supply chain and procurement functions; however, most
   technologies are not being leveraged to directly address ACTA or global
   health outcomes. Some blockchain and RFID technologies incorporated ACTA
   mechanisms and mentioned specific policy/governance frameworks, but more
   purposeful linkage is needed. Findings point to the need for targeted
   policy development and governance to activate these innovative
   technologies to improve global health .},

Abstract = {Introduction: The globalization of the pharmaceutical supply chain has
   introduced new challenges, chief among them, fighting the international
   criminal trade in fake medicines. As the manufacture, supply, and
   distribution of drugs becomes more complex, so does the need for
   innovative technology-based solutions to protect patients globally.
   Areas covered: We conducted a multidisciplinary review of the
   science/health, information technology, computer science, and general
   academic literature with the aim of identifying cutting-edge existing
   and emerging `digital' solutions to combat fake medicines. Our review
   identified five distinct categories of technology including mobile,
   radio frequency identification, advanced computational methods, online
   verification, and blockchain technology.
   Expert opinion: Digital fake medicine solutions are unifying platforms
   that integrate different types of anti-counterfeiting technologies as
   complementary solutions, improve information sharing and data
   collection, and are designed to overcome existing barriers of adoption
   and implementation. Investment in this next generation technology is
   essential to ensure the future security and integrity of the global drug
   supply chain.},

Title = {Facilitating Patient-Centric Thinking in Hospital Facility Management: A
   Case of Pharmaceutical Inventory},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},

Abstract = {Conventional hospital facility management (FM) focuses on reasonably
   allocating various resources to support core healthcare services from
   the perspectives of the FM department and hospital. However, since
   patients are the main service targets of hospitals, the patients'
   demographic and hospitalization information can be integrated to support
   the patient-centric facility management, aiming at a higher level of
   patient satisfaction with respect to the hospital environment and
   services. Taking the pharmaceutical services in hospital inpatient
   departments as the case, forecasting the pharmaceutical demands based on
   the admitted patients' information contributes to not only better
   logistics management and cost containment, but also to securing the
   medical requirements of individual patients. In patient-centric facility
   management, the pharmacy inventory is regarded as the combination of
   medical resources that are reserved and allocated to each admitted
   patient. Two forecasting models are trained to predict the inpatients'
   total medical requirement at the beginning of the hospitalization and
   rectify the patients' length of stay after early treatment.
   Specifically, once a patient is admitted to the hospital, certain
   amounts of medical resources are reserved, according to the inpatient's
   gender, age, diagnosis, and their preliminary expected days in the
   hospital. The allocated inventory is updated after the early treatment
   by rectifying the inpatient's estimated length of stay. The proposed
   procedure is validated using medical data from eighteen hospitals in a
   Chinese city. This study facilitates the integration of patient-related
   information with the conventional FM processes and demonstrates the
   potential improvement in patients' satisfaction with better hospital
   logistics and pharmaceutical services.},

Abstract = {Data Integrity, which is data deemed Attributable, Legible,
   Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, and
   Available (ALCOA-plus), has been the focus of the pharmaceutical
   industry in recent years. With the growing use of computerized systems
   and rising prevalence of outsourcing manufacturing processes, ensuring
   data integrity is becoming more challenging in an increasingly complex
   pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. To address this issue, multiple
   legislation and guidance documents such as `Data Integrity and
   Compliance with CGMP Guidance for Industry' from the US Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA), `GxP' Data Integrity Guidance and Definitions from
   the UK Medicines \& Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and
   `Guidance on Good Data and Record Management Practices' from the World
   Health Organization (WHO), have been published in recent years. However,
   with rising data integrity issues observed by FDA, WHO, MHRA and other
   pharmaceutical inspectors even after these guidance documents have been
   published, their overall effectiveness is yet to be determined.
   This paper compares and evaluates the legislation and guidance currently
   in existence; and discusses some of the potential challenges
   pharmaceutical manufacturers face in maintaining data integrity with
   such legislation and guidance in place. It appears that these
   legislation and guidance are insufficient in maintaining data integrity
   in the industry when used alone. Last, but not least, this paper also
   reviews other solutions, such as the need for a company culture of
   integrity, a good database management system, education and training,
   robust quality agreements between contract givers and acceptors, and
   performance of effective audits and inspections, to aid in maintaining
   data integrity in the manufacturing industry. These proposed solutions,
   if successfully implemented, can address the issues associated with data
   integrity, and raise the standard of pharmaceutical and
   biopharmaceutical manufacturing worldwide.},

   distributors and clients. Currently, the large number of intermediaries
   are a challenge for this sector, as it makes all the processes more
   complicated. In this paper we propose a system that uses smart contracts
   to remove intermediaries and speed up logistics activities. In addition,
   a multi-agent system is used to coordinate entire logistics services,
   smart contracts and compliance with their terms. Our new model combines
   smart contracts and a multi-agent system to improve the current
   logistics system by increasing organization, security and significantly
   improving distribution times.},

Abstract = {e-Prescription systems are key components and drivers of digital health.
   They can enhance the safety of the patients, and are gaining popularity
   in health care systems around the world. Yet, there is little knowledge
   on comparative international analysis of e-Prescription systems'
   architecture and digital security. We report, in this study, original
   findings from a comparative analysis of the e-Prescription systems in
   eight different countries, namely, Canada, United States, United
   Kingdom, Australia, Spain, Japan, Sweden, and Denmark. We surveyed the
   databases related to pharmacies, eHealth, e-Prescriptions, and related
   digital health websites for each country, and their system
   architectures. We also compared the digital security and privacy
   protocols in place within and across these digital systems. We evaluated
   the systems' authentication protocols used by pharmacies to verify
   patients' identities during the medication dispensing process.
   Furthermore, we examined the supporting systems/services used to manage
   patients' medication histories and enhance patients' medication safety.
   Taken together, we report, in this study, original comparative findings
   on the limitations and challenges of the surveyed systems as well as in
   adopting e-Prescription systems. While the present study was conducted
   before the onset of COVID-19, e-Prescription systems have become highly
   relevant during the current pandemic and hence, a deeper understanding
   of the country systems' architecture and digital security that can help
   design effective strategies against the pandemic. e-Prescription systems
   can help reduce physical contact and the risk of exposure to the virus,
   as well as the wait times in pharmacies, thus enhancing patient safety
   and improving planetary health.},

Title = {Digital maturity assessment model for pharmaceutical supply chain: a
   patient and hospital-centred development},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {This paper presents a digital transformation maturity self-assessment
   model. The main objective of this model is the diagnosis and the
   evaluation of the digital maturity of a hospital as a key main in the
   Moroccan pharmaceutical supply chain. A literature review was conducted
   for investigating digital maturity models and tools used. A total of 49
   relevant works were retrieved, representing 49 distinct maturity models
   and tools in various domains. The works were inductively analysed, and
   the maturity model dimensions were extracted and consolidated into a
   Digital Maturity Assessment Model (DMAM). The resulting DMAM consisted
   of 4 dimensions: IT \& Digital Technologies, Strategy \& Processes
   Management, Human Resources \& Culture, and Supply Chain \& Patient
   Journeys Management. Each dimension is further divided into several
   sub-dimensions, totally 65 sub-dimensions are identified, that can be
   assessed by the 4 digital maturity levels proposed. The comparison of
   the proposed digital maturity dimensions and sub-dimensions with the
   existing models/tools shows a clear and important contribution in the
   field of digital transformation assessment: the introduction of a new
   dimension `Supply Chain and Patient Management', that was developed in
   response to practitioner needs and organizational factors in
   pharmaceutical supply chain.},

   medicines},
Journal = {ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is redefining how we exist in the world. In
   almost every sector of society, AI is performing tasks with super-human
   speed and intellect; from the prediction of stock market trends to
   driverless vehicles, diagnosis of disease, and robotic surgery. Despite
   this growing success, the pharmaceutical field is yet to truly harness
   AI. Development and manufacture of medicines remains largely in a `one
   size fits all' paradigm, in which mass-produced, identical formulations
   are expected to meet individual patient needs. Recently, 3D printing
   (3DP) has illuminated a path for on-demand production of fully
   customisable medicines. Due to its flexibility, pharmaceutical 3DP
   presents innumerable options during formulation development that
   generally require expert navigation. Leveraging AI within pharmaceutical
   3DP removes the need for human expertise, as optimal process parameters
   can be accurately predicted by machine learning. AI can also be
   incorporated into a pharmaceutical 3DP `Internet of Things', moving the
   personalised production of medicines into an intelligent, streamlined,
   and autonomous pipeline. Supportive infrastructure, such as The Cloud
   and blockchain, will also play a vital role. Crucially, these
   technologies will expedite the use of pharmaceutical 3DP in clinical
   settings and drive the global movement towards personalised medicine and
   Industry 4.0. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed several limitations of existing
   healthcare systems. Thus, there is a surge in healthcare innovation and
   new business models using computer-mediated virtual environments to
   provide an alternative healthcare system. Today, digital transformation
   is not limited to virtual communication alone but encompasses
   digitalizing the network of social connections in the healthcare
   industry using metaverse technology. The metaverse is a universal and
   immersive virtual world facilitated by virtual reality (VR) and
   augmented reality (AR). This paper presents the first effort to offer a
   comprehensive survey that examines the latest metaverse developments in
   the healthcare industry, which covers seven domains: telemedicine,
   clinical care, education, mental health, physical fitness, veterinary,
   and pharmaceuticals. We review metaverse applications and deeply discuss
   technical issues and available solutions in each domain that can help
   develop a self-sustaining, persistent, and future-proof solution for
   medical healthcare systems. Finally, we highlight the challenges that
   must be tackled before fully embracing the metaverse for the healthcare
   industry.},

Title = {Evaluating the Performance of a Safe Insulin Supply Chain Using the
   AHP-TOPSIS Approach},

Abstract = {People with type 1 diabetes require insulin, a lifesaving and essential
   medication, to maintain their blood sugar levels below dangerous levels.
   Unfortunately, the insulin industry faces supply and affordability
   issues, and patients and their families face an enormous burden. As a
   result of high prices and lack of availability, individuals are turning
   to other options for purchasing insulin, such as online pharmacies,
   which may or may not be legitimate. Despite the necessity of safe
   insulin for diabetics in the legitimate Pharmaceutical Supply Chain
   (PSC), few researchers have considered implementing strategies to
   maximize patient safety for purchasing insulin. Therefore, the current
   research seeks to bridge this gap and provide cohesive information on
   overcoming this challenge and maximizing insulin safety. This study
   employs a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) model that combines
   Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) metrics, Analytic Hierarchy
   Process (AHP), and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to
   Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to develop a model that can prioritize and
   select the best criteria for maximizing insulin safety and achieving the
   study objective. A comparison of two insulin supply chain scenarios was
   performed. As a result of this research, adding a traceability
   technology to the insulin supply chain, specifically blockchain (T42) in
   scenario 2 provides the best results to the supply chain for maximizing
   and ensuring the safety of insulin, as compared to scenario 1, where the
   final score achieved almost 71\%. This research provides a useful tool
   for assessing the safety of other critical goods that customers value in
   strategic and complex decision-making. Academics, professionals, and
   decision-makers can benefit from this research using a rigorous
   scientific decision-support system.},

Abstract = {The papers in this special focus on enabling technologies for next
   generation telehealthcare applications. The use of Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT) for health and well-being is rapidly
   increasing in the majority of high-income countries. The interest about
   telehealthcare allows the provisioning of various kinds of
   health-related services and applications over the Internet. There are
   several benefits associated with tele-healthcare, including: the
   reduction of infection risk due to optimized patients access to clinical
   centers; optimized healthcare workflows; containment of hospital costs;
   increased patient safety; improves in the quality of life of both
   patients and their families. Common telehealthcare applications include
   tele-nursing, tele-rehabilitation, tele-dialog, tele-monitoring,
   tele-analysis, tele-pharmacy, tele-care, tele-psychiatry,
   tele-radiology, tele-pathology, teledermatology, tele-dentistry,
   tele-audiology, tele-ophthalmology, etc. In the past ten years, key
   enabling technologies (KETs) such as Internet of Things (IoT), tools for
   big data management and processing, Cloud/Edge/Fog computing, Artificial
   Intelligence (AI), Blockchain reached an advanced maturity, and
   therefore the potential for revolutionizing the whole tele-healthcare
   sector.},

Abstract = {Shared ledger technologies, as exemplified by Blockchain, provide a new
   framework for supporting business collaborations that is based on having
   a high-reliability, shared, trusted, privacy-preserving, nonrepudiable
   data repository that includes programmable logic in the form of ``smart
   contracts{''}. The framework has the potential to dramatically transform
   business collaboration across numerous industry sectors, including
   finance, supply chain, food production, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare.
   Widespread adoption of this technology will be accelerated by the
   development of business-level languages for specifying smart contracts.
   This paper proposes that data-aware business processes, and in
   particular the Business Artifact paradigm, can provide a robust basis
   for a shared ledger Business Collaboration Language (BCL). The
   fundamental rationale for adopting data-aware processes is that shared
   ledgers focus on both data and process in equal measure. The paper
   examines potential advantages of the artifact-based approach from two
   perspectives: conceptual modeling, and opportunities for formal
   reasoning (verification). Broad research challenges for the development,
   understanding, and usage of a shared ledger BCL are highlighted.},

Title = {Supply chain risk factor assessment of Indian pharmaceutical industry
   for performance improvement},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of the present work is to improve the industry
   performance by identifying and quantifying the risks faced by the Indian
   pharmaceutical industry (IPI). The risk values for the prominent risks
   and overall industry are determined based on the four risk parameters,
   which would help determine the most contributive risks for mitigation.
   Design/methodology/approach An extensive literature survey was done to
   identify the risks, which were also validated by industry experts. The
   finalized risks were then evaluated using the fuzzy synthetic evaluation
   (FSE) method, which is the most suitable approach for the risk
   assessment with parameters having a set of different risk levels.
   Findings The three most contributive sub-risks are counterfeit drugs,
   demand fluctuations and loss of customers due to partners' poor service
   performance, while the main risks obtained are demand, financial and
   logistics. Also, the overall risk value indicates that the industry
   faces medium to high risk. Practical implications The study identifies
   the critical risks which need to be mitigated for an efficient industry.
   The industry is most vulnerable to the demand risk category. Therefore,
   the managers should minimize this risk by mitigating its sub-risks, like
   demand fluctuations, bullwhip effect, etc. Another critical sub-risk,
   the counterfeit risk, should be managed by adopting advanced
   technologies like blockchain, artificial intelligence, etc.
   Originality/value There is insufficient literature focusing on risk
   quantification. Therefore, this work addresses this gap and obtains the
   industry's most critical risks. It also discusses suitable mitigation
   strategies for better industry performance.},

Abstract = {With peer-to-peer software technologies based on Blockchain and Smart
   Contracts, automated negotiation of client-server relationships for
   enterprise networking and project-oriented fractal organizations can now
   be readily implemented. To this aim, the distributed (emergent) schedule
   of client-server contracts must be a Nash equilibrium from which any
   agent finds no incentive to deviate. Also, to respond effectively to
   unplanned events and disturbances, the renegotiating process of all
   concerned client-server contracts must pursue a new Nash equilibrium
   solution in the face of incomplete information by each individual agent.
   In this work, distributed multi-project (re)scheduling is formulated as
   a repeated-negotiation game in a multi-agent setting where each agent
   resorts to decoupled learning rules for deciding the terms and
   conditions in each contract settlement. After a finite number of stages
   of the negotiation game, a new emergent schedule close to a Nash
   equilibrium is found. An agent-based simulation framework is proposed to
   implement the repeated negotiation game based on bilateral client-server
   contracts. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated
   using a case study of a project-oriented fractal company in the
   pharmaceutical industry. Simulation results obtained highlight that
   repeated negotiations and decoupled learning are key for approaching a
   Nash equilibrium and welfare solutions to a (re)scheduling problem.},

Abstract = {Medication dispensing errors are a great risk in pharmacies. These
   errors can be the result of issues such as heavy workload,
   misinterpretation of a prescriber's handwriting, or simply handing the
   wrong medication to the wrong patient. Hence, researchers have recently
   proposed the use of e-prescription to overcome these issues. Moreover,
   several mobile apps that use Near Field Communication (NFC) have been
   proposed for managing patients' medication intake instructions and
   reminding them about intake times. However, neither the e-prescription
   nor medication management apps solve dispensing errors. Therefore, we
   developed an NFC-based system comprised of mobile applications for
   patients' smartphones to transfer verification information through NFC
   and a pharmacy management system connected to an NFC reader.
   Furthermore, to ensure the security of the patient's sensitive
   information, we require biometric authentication to gain access to the
   mobile application. This authentication feature is also used to restrict
   access to the information to the legitimate user only during the
   medication dispensing process. Finally, we believe the proposed system
   will help to reduce medication dispensing errors.},

Title = {An interdisciplinary review of digital technologies to facilitate
   anti-corruption, transparency and accountability in medicines
   procurement},
Journal = {GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION},

Abstract = {Background: Pharmaceutical corruption is a serious challenge in global
   health. Digital technologies that can detect and prevent fraud and
   corruption are particularly important to address barriers to access to
   medicines, such as medicines availability and affordability, stockouts,
   shortages, diversion, and infiltration of substandard and falsified
   medicines. Objectives: To better understand how digital technologies are
   used to combat corruption, increase transparency, and detect fraud in
   pharmaceutical procurement systems to improve population health
   outcomes. Methods: We conducted a multidisciplinary review of the
   health/medicine, engineering, and computer science literature. Our
   search queries included keywords associated with medicines procurement
   and digital technology in combination with terms associated with
   transparency and anti-corruption initiatives. Our definition of `digital
   technology' focused on Internet-based communications, including online
   portals and management systems, supply chain tools, and electronic
   databases. Results: We extracted 37 articles for in-depth review based
   on our inclusion criteria focused on the utilization of digital
   technology to improve medicines procurement. The vast majority of
   articles focused on electronic data transfer and/or e-procurement
   systems with fewer articles discussing emerging technologies such as
   machine learning and blockchain distributed ledger solutions. In the
   context of e-procurement, slow adoption, justifying cost-savings, and
   need for technical standards setting were identified as key challenges
   for current and future utilization. Conclusions: Though there is a
   significant promise for digital technologies, particularly
   e-procurement, overall adoption of solutions that can enhance
   transparency, accountability and concomitantly combat corruption, is
   still underdeveloped. Future efforts should focus on tying cost-saving
   measurements with anti-corruption indicators, prioritizing
   centralization of e-procurement systems, establishing regulatory
   harmonization with standards setting, and incorporating additional
   anti-corruption technologies into procurement processes for improving
   access to medicines and to reach the overall goal of Universal Health
   Coverage.},

Title = {Distributed Ledger Infrastructure to Verify Adverse Event Reporting
   (DeLIVER): Proposal for a Proof-of-Concept Study},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Adverse drug event reporting is critical for ensuring
   patient safety; however, numbers of reports have been declining. There
   is a need for a more user-friendly reporting system and for a means of
   verifying reports that have been filed.
   Objective: This project has 2 main objectives: (1) to identify the
   perceived benefits and barriers in the current reporting of adverse
   events by patients and health care providers and (2) to develop a
   distributed ledger infrastructure and user interface to collect and
   collate adverse event reports to create a comprehensive and
   interoperable database.
   Methods: A review of the literature will be conducted to identify the
   strengths and limitations of the current UK adverse event reporting
   system (the Yellow Card System). If insufficient information is found in
   this review, a survey will be created to collect data from system users.
   The results of these investigations will be incorporated into the
   development of a mobile and web app for adverse event reporting. A
   digital infrastructure will be built using distributed ledger technology
   to provide a means of linking reports with existing pharmaceutical
   tracking systems.
   Results: The key outputs of this project will be the development of a
   digital infrastructure, including a backend distributed ledger system
   and an app-based user interface.
   Conclusions: This infrastructure is expected to improve the accuracy and
   efficiency of adverse event reporting systems by enabling the monitoring
   of specific medicines or medical devices over their life course while
   protecting patients' personal health data.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to better understand how codified knowledge that
   originates in organizations contributes to the generation of
   idiosyncratic knowledge embedded at a more expansive level, such as that
   of an ecosystem. In doing so, the authors introduce the concept of
   patent ecosystems - conceived as configurations of codified knowledge
   advancements protected via patents. Design/methodology/approach Using a
   patent co-classification method and introducing a novel validated
   software, the authors map and visualize the patent ecosystem of
   Singapore and examine 173,597 patents published from 1995 to 2020.
   Findings Results reveal the prominent growth of Singapore's patenting
   activities, capturing a patent ecosystem shift, from a more diverse
   knowledge configuration to a more specialized one. The codified
   knowledge mainly generated deals with pharmaceuticals and high-tech
   knowledge domains; further, newly emerging technologies such as
   blockchain are also noted. Research limitations/implications The
   research investigates Singapore's context, a country in which research
   directions and focus areas are influenced by government interventions
   and leadership. Thus, future studies might examine other patent
   ecosystems to draw comparisons with more laissez-faire policies or
   ecosystems with more pronounced organic development. Originality/value
   The novelty of this research is the introduction of the concept of a
   patent ecosystem for advancing a more fine-grained understanding of the
   aggregated knowledge generated at the ecosystem level and its specific
   features, composition and development. The authors consider patents as
   ``carriers{''} of different codified pieces of knowledge and patent
   ecosystems represent the configuration that emerges from connections of
   these elements. The novel approach can aid both researchers,
   practitioners and policymakers with future examinations in the field.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the implementations of digital twins (DTs) in the
   context of supply chains (SCs) and disruption risks. The concept of a
   digital supply chain twin (DSCT) has been a trending topic in recent
   years, but very little of the literature deals with case studies and
   actual applications. Therefore, this study concentrates on reviewing the
   implementations of DSCTs. Moreover, disruption risks associated with the
   current pandemic have encouraged the adoption of DSCTs to improve SC
   resilience and agility. For those reasons, this study analyzes the
   literature according to different industry sectors' implementations
   (e.g., food, aerospace and automotive, construction, pharmaceutical, and
   general manufacturing industries). Additionally, literature concentrated
   on applications for SC risks is studied. This literature review unveils
   the current developments of DSCTs in the specific industries covered and
   risks applications. Hence, this work is intended to help SC
   practitioners and researchers identify challenges and potential research
   areas for DSCTs.},

Title = {Consumer Purchasing Behavior Toward Green Environment in the Healthcare
   Industry: Mediating Role of Entrepreneurial Innovation and Moderating
   Effect of Absorptive Capacity},

Abstract = {Entrepreneurial innovations lead to transformations in the existing
   business model, involving them integrating the new knowledge into the
   established entrepreneurial activities. The current study combines
   marketing strategies, entrepreneurial innovation, absorptive capacity,
   and consumer purchasing behavior in the health sector. This study
   investigates the impact of packaging and labeling strategies on
   entrepreneurial innovation and consumer purchasing behavior. Therefore,
   this study also investigates the mediating effect of entrepreneurial
   innovation between packaging and labeling strategies and consumer
   purchasing behavior. The study examines the moderating role of
   absorptive capacity between entrepreneurial innovation and consumer
   purchasing behavior. While using convenience sampling, this study used
   the consumer of medications as a sample from China. The research adopted
   a quantitative method to conduct the study analysis. A well-structured
   questionnaire with a 5-point Likert scale has used for the study
   analysis. The adopted questionnaires were utilized in data collection
   with 702 with a 70\% response rate, and Smart PLS was used to analyze
   the data. The findings of this study indicate that packaging and
   labeling strategies significantly influence entrepreneurial innovation
   and consumer purchasing behavior. Entrepreneurial innovation
   significantly mediates the packaging and labeling strategies and
   consumer purchasing behavior. The moderating role of absorptive capacity
   significantly affects entrepreneurial innovation and consumer purchasing
   behavior. The implications of the investigated model with innovative
   marketing strategies give new insights for managerial, policymakers, and
   research perspectives.},

Abstract = {Quantumization, the process of converting information into quantum
   (qubit) format, is a key enabler for propelling a new and distinct
   infrastructure in the pharmaceutical space. Quantum messenger RNA
   (QmRNA) technology, an indispensable constituent of quantum biotech
   (QB), is a compelling alternative to conventional vaccine methods
   because of its capacity for rapid development, high efficacy, and
   low-cost manufacturing to combat infectious diseases. Internet of Virus
   Things (IoVT), a biological version of Internet of Things (IoT),
   comprises applications to fight against pandemics and provides effective
   vaccine administration. The integration of QB and IoVT constitutes the
   QBIoVT system to advance the prospect of QmRNA vaccine discovery within
   a few days. This research disseminates the QBIoVT system paradigm,
   including architectural aspects, priority areas, challenges,
   applications, and QmRNA research engine design to accelerate QmRNA
   vaccines discovery. A comprehensive review of the literature was
   accomplished, and a context-centered methodology was applied to the
   QBIoVT paradigm forensic investigations to impel QmRNA vaccine
   discovery. Based on the above rumination, the principal motive for this
   study was to develop a novel QBIoVT theoretical framework which has not
   been produced through earlier theories. The proposed framework shall
   inspire future QBIoVT system research activities to improve pandemics
   detection and protection.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates how firms configure their business process
   management efforts in different industries. We generate a business
   process management (BPM) skills taxonomy through the computational
   linguistic analysis of job ads from Monster.com . We apply the taxonomy
   to LinkedIn.com resumes of professionals employed at retailer Walmart,
   pharmaceutical company Pfizer, and investment bank Goldman Sachs. We
   find that Walmart and Pfizer distribute change- and operations-related
   BPM skills among the same roles whereas Goldman Sachs distributes both
   kinds of skills among more separate roles. This separation reflects a
   trilateral configuration where line managers and analysts focus on
   operational BPM tasks related to running processes while change-related
   tasks are covered by project managers. At Walmart and Pfizer the tasks
   of the BPM project manager are shared among managers and analysts,
   reflecting a bilateral configuration. Comparing each firm's regulatory
   environments and BPM technology capabilities, we conjecture that the
   organizational configuration pattern is influenced by a firm's ability
   to reliably automate business processes, since this affects how much
   attention line managers and analysts have to spend on monitoring
   processes and on reconciling issues and exceptions. This attention could
   otherwise be spent on regulatory-imposed process change efforts. This
   configural logic suggests a reconfiguration of BPM professionals towards
   a bilateral configuration when an organization transforms its business
   with digital technology, because the focus of such efforts includes
   process and decision automation.},

Abstract = {Drawing on information processing theory and resource-based view (RBV),
   this study examines the impact of industry 4.0 on supply chain
   performance (SCP). The study also explores how supply chain resilience
   (SCRes) and supply chain visibility (SCV) influence the association
   between Industry4.0 and SC performance. Cross-sectional data was
   collected from 458 respondents working in food, beverage, and
   pharmaceutical companies using a close-ended questionnaire. The study
   employed partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to
   analyze the hypothesized relationships. The findings confirmed a
   significant and substantial impact of In-dustry4.0 on SC performance.
   Similarly, findings also depicted a significant mediating role of SCRes
   between Industry 4.0 and SCP. Furthermore, results also found a
   significant moderating role of SCV in a way that it reinforced the
   impact of Industry 4.0 on SCRes. This study provides an understanding of
   Industry 4.0 applications and their role between SCRes and SCV. The
   results of the study suggest the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies
   uplifts SC resilience and SC performance thereon.},

Title = {SEIR-FMi: A coronavirus disease epidemiological model based on
   intra-city movement, inter-city movement and medical resource investment},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
   epidemiological model called SEIR-FMi (Susceptible
   -Exposed-Infectious-Recovery with Flow and Medical investments) to study
   the effects of intra-city population movement, inter-city population
   movement, and medical resource investment on the spread of the COVID-19
   epidemic. We theoretically derived the reproduction number of the
   SEIR-FMi model by using the next -generation matrix method and
   empirically simulate the individual impacts of population movement and
   medi-cal resource investment on epidemic control. We found that
   intra-and inter-city population movements will increase the risk of
   epidemic spread, and the effect of inter-city population movement on
   low-risk areas is higher than that on high-risk areas. Increasing
   medical resource investment can not only speed up the recover rate of
   patients but also reduce the growth rate of infected cases and shorten
   the spread duration of the epidemic. We collected data on intra-city
   population movement, inter-city population movement, medical resource
   investment, and confirmed cases in the cities of Wuhan, Jingzhou, and
   Xiangyang, Hubei Province, China, from January 15 to March 15, 2020.
   Using the collected data, we validated that the proposed SEIR-FMi model
   performs well in simulating the spread of COVID-19 in the three cities.
   Meanwhile, this study confirms that three non -pharmaceutical
   interventions, namely community isolation, population mobility control,
   and medical resource aid, applied during the epidemic period are
   indispensable in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in the three cities.},

Title = {Data-Driven Analytics Leveraging Artificial Intelligence in the Era of
   COVID-19: An Insightful Review of Recent Developments},

Abstract = {This paper presents the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and other
   latest technologies that were employed to fight the recent pandemic
   (i.e., novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)). These technologies
   assisted the early detection/diagnosis, trends analysis, intervention
   planning, healthcare burden forecasting, comorbidity analysis, and
   mitigation and control, to name a few. The key-enablers of these
   technologies was data that was obtained from heterogeneous sources
   (i.e., social networks (SN), internet of (medical) things (IoT/IoMT),
   cellular networks, transport usage, epidemiological investigations, and
   other digital/sensing platforms). To this end, we provide an insightful
   overview of the role of data-driven analytics leveraging AI in the era
   of COVID-19. Specifically, we discuss major services that AI can provide
   in the context of COVID-19 pandemic based on six grounds, (i) AI role in
   seven different epidemic containment strategies (a.k.a
   non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)), (ii) AI role in data life
   cycle phases employed to control pandemic via digital solutions, (iii)
   AI role in performing analytics on heterogeneous types of data stemming
   from the COVID-19 pandemic, (iv) AI role in the healthcare sector in the
   context of COVID-19 pandemic, (v) general-purpose applications of AI in
   COVID-19 era, and (vi) AI role in drug design and repurposing (e.g.,
   iteratively aligning protein spikes and applying three/four-fold
   symmetry to yield a low-resolution candidate template) against COVID-19.
   Further, we discuss the challenges involved in applying AI to the
   available data and privacy issues that can arise from personal data
   transitioning into cyberspace. We also provide a concise overview of
   other latest technologies that were increasingly applied to limit the
   spread of the ongoing pandemic. Finally, we discuss the avenues of
   future research in the respective area. This insightful review aims to
   highlight existing AI-based technological developments and future
   research dynamics in this area.},

Title = {Multi-labeled neural network model for automatically processing
   cardiomyocyte mechanical beating signals in drug assessment},
Journal = {BIOSENSORS \& BIOELECTRONICS},

Abstract = {High-throughput cardiotoxicity assessment is important for large-scale
   preclinical screening in novel drug development. To improve the
   efficiency of drug development and avoid drug-induced cardiotoxicity,
   there is a huge demand to explore the automatic and intelligent drug
   assessment platforms for preclinical cardiotoxicity investigations. In
   this work, we proposed an automatic and intelligent strategy that
   combined automatic feature extraction and multi-labeled neural network
   (MLNN) to process cardiomyocytes mechanical beating signals detected by
   an interdigital electrode biosensor for the assessment of drug-induced
   cardiotoxicity. Taking advantages of artificial neural network, our work
   not only classified different drugs inducing different cardiotoxicities
   but also predicted drug concentrations representing severity of
   cardiotoxicity. This has not been achieved by conventional strategies
   like principal component analysis and visualized heatmap. MLNN analysis
   showed high accuracy (up to 96\%) and large AUC (more than 98\%) for
   classification of different drug-induced cardiotoxicities. There was a
   high correlation (over 0.90) between concentrations reported by MLNN and
   experimentally treated concentrations of various drugs, demonstrating
   great capacity of our intelligent strategy to predict the severity of
   drug-induced cardiotoxicity. This new intelligent bio-signal processing
   algorithm is a promising method for identification and classification of
   drug-induced cardiotoxicity in cardiological and pharmaceutical
   applications.},

Abstract = {There is an ongoing debate on the implementation of the COVID-19
   passport throughout Europe. We sought to build and test a feasible
   prevention strategy to ensure low SARS-CoV transmission risk in public
   events. We conducted a non-randomised controlled study. The intervention
   group obtained a confidential digital certificate of very low capacity
   for transmitting SARS-CoV-2 and attended socio-cultural events in Girona
   (Spain) between 1 April and 21 May 2021. The primary care services and a
   network of pharmacies cooperated in providing the certification. A group
   of non-attendees was randomly selected from pseudonymised health records
   as controls. We estimated the incidences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and
   recorded the challenges in the process. Follow-up was complete for 1351
   participants, who were matched with 4050 controls. Mean age of the study
   population was 31.1 years, and 53\% of participants were women.
   Incidence rates of SARS-CoV infection at 14 days in the group of
   attendees and non-attendees were 15.9 and 17.7 per 100,000 person-days,
   respectively; the difference between incidences was - 1.8 (95\% CI -
   22.8, 19.3). Implementation problems were minor, and 89.2\% of
   respondents to a survey were satisfied with the process. The incidence
   rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not different in the intervention and
   control groups. These results are in favour of establishing a COVID-19
   certificate to attend public events, and connote feasibility of
   implementation at a population level.},
