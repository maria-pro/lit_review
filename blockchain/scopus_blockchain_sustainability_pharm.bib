abstract={This research explores the role of Blockchain Technology (BCT) integrated with Reverse Supply Chain Networks (RSCN) and evaluates the relationship between BCT and sustainability performance. A qualitative research design was employed to develop a conceptual framework for BCT in RSCN. This research collected and analysed primary and secondary data from four cases as focal-actors. These focal-actors are from multi-industries in Jordan, namely food, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and toys. These actors are lead-firms and have experience working with RSCNs and technology applications such as BCT. Primary data were acquired from interviews with managers working in these industries, which were supported by the analysis of secondary data that identified two types of themes: internally focused and externally focused BCT-integrated drivers of RSCNs. The analysis also identified how they leverage sustainability performance improvements, including their use of RSCN approaches and features. This research is one of the few attempts to explore BCT integrated into RSCN for better sustainability performance that contributes to the theoretical and practical knowledge of supply chains within emerging economies. All types of actors-as-stakeholders involved with national programs and projects can adopt the new framework. The key findings contribute to the field of RSCN where the adoption of BCT as a broad-based strategy to attain sustainability goals and reverse chain activities along the supply chain is a goal. © 2022 The Author(s).

abstract={Background: This study presents a comprehensive review of blockchain technology with a sustainability orientation in supply chains and logistics. Methods: The publications are extracted from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, comprising 552 publications between 2017 and 2022. Several bibliometric laws and techniques, namely three-field analysis, Bradford’s Law, Lotka’s Law, and thematic maps, are applied in R with the bibliometrix package. Content analysis is also carried out based on 185 publications to appreciate the industry-based view of the field. Results: The bibliometric results indicate that this field is on the rise. Authors, sources, affiliations, countries, keywords, and their relationships are also addressed. The findings of the content analysis and thematic maps reveal that some of the most highlighted themes in the literature include traceability, COVID-19, the internet of things, and Industry 4.0. The most popular industry in this field is discovered to be food and agriculture. Conclusions: This paper contributes to the still relatively scarce literature on how blockchain technology fosters sustainable supply chains and logistics, providing a closer look at blockchain use, methodologies, and future directions for different industries concerning food, agriculture, fashion, textile and apparel, manufacturing, automotive, maritime and shipping, healthcare and pharmaceutical, mining and mineral, and energy. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Healthcare, one of the most important industries, is data-oriented, but most of the research in this industry focuses on incorporating the internet of things (IoT) or connecting medical equipment. Very few researchers are looking at the data generated in the healthcare industry. Data are very important tools in this competitive world, as they can be integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) to promote sustainability. Healthcare data include the health records of patients, drug-related data, clinical trials data, data from various medical equipment, etc. Most of the data management processes are manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. Even then, different healthcare industries do not trust each other to share and collaborate on data. Distributed ledger technology is being used for innovations in different sectors including healthcare. This technology can be incorporated to maintain and exchange data between different healthcare organizations, such as hospitals, insurance companies, laboratories, pharmacies, etc. Various attributes of this technology, such as its immutability, transparency, provenance etc., can bring trust and security to the domain of the healthcare sector. In this paper, a decentralized access control model is proposed to enable the secure interoperability of different healthcare organizations. This model uses the Ethereum blockchain for its implementation. This model interfaces patients, doctors, chemists, and insurance companies, empowering the consistent and secure exchange of data. The major concerns are maintaining a history of the transactions and avoiding unauthorized updates in health records. Any transaction that changes the state of the data is reflected in the distributed ledger and can be easily traced with this model. Only authorized entities can access their respective data. Even the administrator will not be able to modify any medical records. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Due to the rapid increase in environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources, the focus of researchers is shifted from economic to socio-environmental problems. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has the potential to restructure the entire supply chain for sustainable practices. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that provides a digital database for recording all the transactions of the supply chain. The main purpose of this research is to explore the literature relevant to blockchain for sustainable supply chain management. The focus of this review is on the sustainability of the blockchain-based supply chain concerning environmental conservation, social equality, and governance effectiveness. Using a systematic literature review, a total of 136 articles were evaluated and categorized according to the triple bottom-line aspects of sustainability. Challenges and barriers during blockchain adoption in different industrial sectors such as aviation, shipping, agriculture and food, manufacturing, automotive, pharmaceutical, and textile industries were critically examined. This study has not only explored the economic, environmental, and social impacts of blockchain but also highlighted the emerging trends in a circular supply chain with current developments of advanced technologies along with their critical success factors. Furthermore, research areas and gaps in the existing research are discussed, and future research directions are suggested. The findings of this study show that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the entire supply chain from a sustainability perspective. Blockchain will not only improve the economic sustainability of the supply chain through effective traceability, enhanced visibility through information sharing, transparency in processes, and decentralization of the entire structure but also will help in achieving environmental and social sustainability through resource efficiency, accountability, smart contracts, trust development, and fraud prevention. The study will be helpful for managers and practitioners to understand the procedure of blockchain adoption and to increase the probability of its successful implementation to develop a sustainable supply chain network.

abstract={In recent years, traceability systems have been developed as practical tools for improving supply chain (SC) transparency and visibility, especially in health and safety-sensitive sectors like food and pharmaceuticals. Blockchain-related SC traceability research has received significant attention during the last several years, and arguably blockchain is currently the most promising technology for providing traceability-related services in SC networks. This paper provides a systematic literature review of the various technical implementation aspects of blockchain-enabled SC traceability systems. We apply different drivers for classifying the selected literature, such as (a) the various domains of the available blockchain-enabled SC traceability systems and relevant methodologies applied; (b) the implementation maturity of these traceability systems along with technical implementation details; and (c) the sustainability perspective (economic, environmental, social) prevalent to these implementations. We provide key takeaways regarding the open issues and challenges of current blockchain traceability implementations and fruitful future research areas. Despite the significant volume and plethora of blockchain-enabled SC traceability systems, academia has so far focused on unstructured experimentation of blockchain-associated SC traceability solutions, and there is a clear need for developing and testing real-life traceability solutions, especially taking into account feasibility and cost-related SC aspects. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={With increased digitization, huge amount of data is being generated in relation to patient health information, electronic health records, Internet of things (IoT)- based health monitoring systems, insurance data and lot more. Blockchain 3.0 offers huge distributed storage space without much resources at your end, provides scalability without sacrificing security, helps integrating data from different sources without compromising privacy, delivers transparency without revealing ownerships, ensures interoperability without much complexities and establishes provenance with authenticity. Flexibility and multidimensional capability of blockchain technology offers a lot of potential for innovation, integration and sustainability in the healthcare space. Amalgamation of artificial intelligence, analytics and smart contracts helps leveraging core blockchain technology to create better value preposition for all the stakeholders vis-avis entire value chain of healthcare segment. This can be helpful in healthcare audits, clinical research, fighting counterfeit medicines, medical compliances, government regulations, drug supply chain management, claim settlements and many more. This chapter aims at explaining different applications, approaches and models of Blockchain 3.0 implementation across entire value chain of the healthcare system and discusses the most important use cases that can lead to transformation and adds to the sustainability of the entire healthcare industry. This chapter discusses blockchain adoption journey from the technological perspective, viewpoint of challenges, implementation strategies and the way forward. This chapter presents how blockchain technology can impact and affect the broad segments of the healthcare space and improves sustainability. The first and most important use case explains how blockchain helps creating, exchanging and maintaining complete, accurate, secure and transferable healthcare records of patients with all compliances in-place. Smart contracts provide regulated and transparent access to data and can help conflict free faster claim settlement without the need of a middleman. Second use case explains how blockchain can help streamlining the processes of healthcare insurance companies and adds value to the patients as well as to the healthcare business. Blockchain along with artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics helps research and clinical trial management by way of drawing inferences from huge amount of data, fixing accountability and distributing research report in an efficient and cheaper way for faster and better scientific research outcomes. Third case study illustrates the use of Blockchain 3.0 for better management of clinical trials. The fourth use case explains how blockchain improves pharmaceutical supply chain management and mitigates the risk of counterfeit, fake and unapproved drugs and equipment. Of course the adoption of Blockchain 3.0 in medical segment is slow but the value addition offered by the technology to the sustainability of healthcare system have drawn the attentions of researchers, governments and healthcare companies to invest in this domain for a greater and better tomorrow. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

abstract={The future of community pharmacy has always been a matter of concern for academics and practitioners alike. Recently, a paper published in this Journal brought to the discussion the importance of new technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, and the emergence of market forces like Amazon or Google, to the future of the pharmacy profession. In this commentary, we offer our view about the subject, specifically focusing in the practice area of Community Pharmacy. Our choice takes into account the fact that this by far the most numerous group within the profession, and where the fear of redundancy has always been looming since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Envisioned technologies will become a reality, but by now are not mature enough to be the disrupters everyone expects. Moreover, without major shifts in the legal environment regulating the organization of health care and the provision of medicines, big players will find it difficult to substitute pharmacies. As for pharmacists, they have always adapted to the challenges presented by technological revolutions. We argue that for the coming Patient Centred era, it is more important to continue to focus on the sustainability of an enhanced role for community pharmacists, providing services that highlight pharmacists' social role, measuring outcomes, and managing populations’ health. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={We seek to guide operations management (OM) research on the implementation of supply chain traceability systems by identifying business requirements and the factors critical to successful implementation. We first motivate the need for implementing traceability systems in two very different industries—cobalt mining and pharmaceuticals—and present business requirements and critical success factors for implementation. Next, we describe how we carried out thematic analysis of practitioner and scholarly articles on implementing blockchain for supply chain traceability. Finally, we present our results pertaining to the needs of different stakeholders such as suppliers, consumers, and regulators. The business requirements for traceability systems are curbing illegal practices; improving sustainability performance; increasing operational efficiency; enhancing supply-chain coordination; and sensing market trends. Critical success factors for implementation are companies’ capabilities; collaboration; technology maturity; supply chain practices; leadership; and governance of the traceability efforts. These findings provide a nascent measurement model for empirical work and a foundation for descriptive and normative research on blockchain applications for supply chain traceability. © 2019 Production and Operations Management Society},

abstract={The main aim of this study is to explore the role of blockchain technology in the sustainability and effectiveness of the pharmaceutical supply chain in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The objectives of this study are: to explore the opportunities for the blockchain technology to address the existing problems in the pharmaceutical supply chain; to uncover the barriers and challenges of blockchain adoption and implementation; to develop guidelines for a successful implementation of blockchain in the context of Saudi Arabia; and to investigate the perceptions of professionals about the impact of blockchain adoption in the pharmaceutical supply chain sector. The researchers have identified issues surrounding the lack of integration of IT systems in the healthcare systems in KSA. Further problems have been identified: such as medication shortage, lack of coordination among healthcare stakeholders, product wastage and lack of medication demand information. Blockchain, as a distributed digital ledger technology which ensures transparency, traceability and security, is considered as a promise for easing some supply chain management problems. The evaluation of the impact of 'Technology, Organisation, Environment' (TOE) theory, will provide a clear picture to comprehend the influence of these factors on the sustainability of the supply chain, and thus the supply chain effectiveness. This study provides a theoretical model for the impact of blockchain implementation on the sustainability and effectiveness of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Researchers highlighted issues in the current management of the pharmaceutical supply chain and explained how blockchain can be used to solve these problems and how blockchain can address and support the sustainability of supply chains. While the technology of blockchain is definitely in its infancy, the researchers have already seen success in its everyday deployment, especially in the pharmaceutical and financial sectors.

abstract={Background: Drug counterfeiting is a global problem with significant risks to consumers and the general public. In the Philippines, 30% of inspected drug stores in 2003 were found with substandard/spurious/falsely-labeled/falsified/counterfeit drugs. The economic burden on the population drug expenditures and on governments is high. The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages the public to check the certificates of product registration and report any instances of counterfeiting. The National Police of Philippines responds to such reports through a special task force. However, no literature on its impact on the distribution of such drugs were found. Blockchain technology is a cryptographic ledger that is allegedly immutable through repeated sequential hashing and fault-tolerant through a consensus algorithm. This project will develop and test a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system that will support information sharing along the official drug distribution network. Objective: This study aims to develop a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system and test its functions in a simulated network. Methods: We are developing a Distributed Application (DApp) that will run on smart contracts, employing Swarm as the Distributed File System (DFS). Two instances will be developed: one for Ethereum and another for Hyperledger Fabric. The proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm of Ethereum will be modified into a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) or practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm as it is scalable and fits the drug supply chain environment. The system will adopt the GS1 pedigree standard and will satisfy the data points in the data standardization guidelines from the US FDA. Simulations will use the following 5 nodes: for FDA, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and the consumer portal. Results: Development is underway. The design of the system will place FDA in a supervisory data verification role, with each pedigree type–specific data source serving a primary data verification role. The supply chain process will be initiated by the manufacturer, with recursive verification for every transaction. It will allow consumers to scan a code printed on the receipt of their purchases to review the drug distribution history. Conclusions: Development and testing will be conducted in a simulated network, and thus, results may differ from actual practice. The project being proposed is disruptive; once tested, the team intends to engage the Philippine FDA to discuss implementation plans and formulate policies to facilitate adoption and sustainability. © Patrick Sylim, Fang Liu, Alvin Marcelo, Paul Fontelo.},
